hey danielim sending you what i wrote for your reference letter let me know what you think and if there are some things youd like me to focus moreless on im perfectly happy making changes if youd like me toby the way i mean every word of the letteri had the pleasure of being daniels leader for a summer camp in the czech republic last summer one of the things that stood out most to me about daniel was his cultural curiosity he showed a genuine desire to learn about the history and culture of the participants represented at our camp something that the other participants really appreciated whether he was learning about the political situation in turkey or dancing with the brazilian delegates he thoroughly took advantage of the cultural diversity of the camp and walked away with a much greater understanding of the world and its people i was constantly amazed by daniels intelligence and independence of thought during activities discussions and debriefing he showed an ability to reflect on and articulate complex ideas to the group in an inclusive and constructive way he was able to make the group think of things that they would not have necessarily considered most importantly he did so in an empowering and tactful waythis does not mean that he is the serious type in fact daniel was the camp clown he regularly had the whole camp bent over laughing our delegation looked forward to delegation time to hear what daniel would come up with next he understood when it was time to be serious and when it was time to spread his contagious sense of humour i often witnessed daniel using his humour and his leadership to draw people in and make them feel included in the groupdaniel also worked very well with others while planning activities he provided ideas without dominating discussions and followed through with his responsibilitiesi truly felt lucky to have daniel in my delegation for his leadership his thoughtfulness his commitment to cisv values and his humour his impact was felt across the whole camp other leaders regularly praised him during our leader meetings and made sure that i knew just how lucky i was to have daniel in my group i know without a doubt that his skills and qualities would help make this village unforgettable for all the kids present and would make him a positive role model in the lives of his own delegates for years to come 
dawweeeee this is so great thank you so much for the iym letter thing you dont need to have the last little paragraph but yeah thank you 
hello you there

hey marie i am applying for a postions on the src of the fhs and was wondering if u could give me a reference but the catch is that it is due by wenday it will be sent to gregorypetersnbednbca thanks 
no problem mdear anything in particular i should be focusing on or just your overall awesomeness 
haha thanks you so much sorry for the rushed message but i have been in toronto this weekend for cisv and we havent had wifi i am applying for public relations so nothing in particular i can think of by the way how is the road trip going 
okay here i go itll have to be a bit quick because i also dont have much access to the internet ill send it to you and you can let me know if you need any changesthe trip is interesting but good there have been some downers because of all the vehicles breaking down and all and waiting planning improvising figuring out logistics etc im currently in eureka springs arkansas and will be here for a few days its really awesome here we went to see a bluegrass band play last night in a total dirt bag bar it was great ill post pictures to my blog today or tomorrow i just took some stuff from the other one id written and changed a few things let me know if thats okay as soon as you okay it i will send it into the world wide web across the midwest over the appalachian mountain range and all the way to gregory peters in frederictonto whom it may concerni had the pleasure of being daniels leader for a cisv summer camp in the czech republic last summer where youth from nine countries gathered for three weeks for leadership and peace education activities i was constantly amazed by daniels intelligence and independence of thought during activities discussions and debriefing he showed an ability to reflect on and articulate complex ideas to the group in an inclusive and constructive way he was able to make the group think of things that they would not have necessarily considered most importantly he did so in an empowering and tactful waythis does not mean that he is the serious type in fact daniel was the camp clown he regularly had the whole camp bent over laughing he understood when it was time to be serious and when it was time to spread his contagious sense of humour and lighten the mood i often witnessed daniel using his humour and his leadership to draw people in and make them feel included in the groupdaniel also worked very well with others while planning activities he provided creative input without dominating discussions and followed through with his responsibilities i truly felt lucky to have daniel in my delegation for his leadership his thoughtfulness his commitment to cisv values and his humour his impact was felt across the whole camp other leaders regularly praised him and made sure that i knew just how lucky i was to have daniel in my group i know without a doubt that his skills and qualities would help make next year a successful one for the src specifically in the position of public relations his leadership and humour will draw students in and make the src even more appealing to themfor all these reasons i wholeheartedly recommend daniel lutes for the position of public relations in the src

hey can i get your phone number and would you available for a call tonight or tomorrow also are you in montreal 
my number is 506 261 0224 no i am toronto for the summer i can do tomorrow night at like 7 does that work for you 
im in vancouver at the moment so the earliest i can do is 8pm est 
okay cool thats fine lets do 9pm est does that work 
yep thanks this might be a stupid question but what kind of platform was the website built with 
lol no thats not stupid its on wordpress its mostly configuration not so much coding hey ready for that call 
how was calgary for ya 
the village was really sweet but as a city it wasnt really what i was expecting it wasnt like toronto or montreal a lot of driving haha 
haha yea its a large undence place village though was good 
yea there was some tension sometimes with staff and jcs but overall it was good you done high school yet 
going into grade 12 were karen and jessica decent and youre done right 
no one more year too hows shit with the junior board there 
uh you guys 
same im not ljr any more so i feel like im kinda free 
i feel the exact same but i know that there will still be a lot of work that ill end up doing 
haha yea same what are your plans for after high school 
i want to be a junior councillpr or do seminar but so far ive planned to go to brasil and visit friends from village and summercamp has jcing been your favourite 
not really i think it was like a more rewarding tan other cisv experiences but at the same time when you are a junior councillpr there are only 5 others so you kinda have to hope for a good group i did a my when i was 16 which is similar to a seminar and i made closer friends amd overall had more fun 
was the group dynamic good no matter what im going make sure to do seminar 
with the jcs we were really close but with the leaders they would fight a fair amount and as a junior councillpr sometimes i kinda felt like my opinion wasnt as valued 
that sucks at least all the jcs got along who was the other canadian 
brianna partridge from saskatoon 
oh thats sweet how were the kids 
they were all really awesome by far the best part of the whole experience they are kinda what makes dealing with other shit worth it 
its sounds like a fair bit of shit went down any worse then the shit of junior board 
haha yeah same style of shit people not doing what they say they will do 
haha fair enough but overall it went unhinged or no the drama was a lot 
i steared clear of the drama as much as possible so it wasnt to to bad if you have the chance to junior councillpr and do seminar do both 
ill try im pretty stoked to be going to brasil 
where in brazil are you going 
my friends are from brasilia and then were going to racifi and salvador jaoa passoa sao paulo and rio 
holy shit thats a sweet trip how long are you going for

that would be amazing and u have to give me 500 if u win because i tough u everything u no about spelling by the way nothing is happening in nb as always 
haha yes it would be amazing and pfftof course you taught me everything i know in spelling truebut if anything doesi better know about it or pps five hundred dollars out of 15000 seems to little doesnt it 
ya give 20000 to me

nice and dont worry not that elaborated tk make kd haha oh my god you made my feature look so good d thanks a lot question tho is there a way to stop the timer on the pictures 
yea i can turn it off 
thank you or maybe put it a bit longer 
how long 30s or is that too long 
maybe 10 just enough to be able to read the caption of the first 
yea i set it to 20 i feel like that is enough time 4 people who read slow 
okay thanks a lot 
no problem 
you might hate me right now but actually can you make it 30 sec i think its better if people have to actually switch photos by themselves i personnally dont have enough time to read lol 
haha yea sure no problem 
hey 
yeah no problem sounds good d 
thanks 
do you know anyplace that i could get a list of the summer camp offers to canada 
no where public and like i said fredericton wont know where we are going till after november 14th 
oh okay thanks anyway is there a junior board meeting this weekend 
most likely sunday mias 6 
okay cool you come to 12 hours for the homeless 
cant but i really wanted to 
ah is megan do you know where the summer camps are 
hey right now im in toronto airport but yesterday we did chose where freddy is going sadly our opertunitie as extreamly limated we only have one summercamp and i belive its for 14 years olds in the winter we really got screwed this year im sorry i tryed 
well this suck maybe an opportunity will present itself later on this year you wouldnt happen to know when our next meeting is 
as of right now its 16th this teusday and i might have an oppertunity for you its a month long program only in canada its still in the works but im going to push it through theres only 2 spaces avilable so youd be somewhat conpetting with me but you have to keep it on the down low 
oh what kind of activity is it 
12 subjectaucun sujet okay its called the peace bus and it drives across canada with one youth from every chapter its 32 days long 22 and it leaves from vancouver to halifax then from halifax to vancouver so freddy have two seats one each way 
is it a new program 
12 subjectaucun sujet yes but the cach is if we dont have 2 leadersdrivers by febuary its impossable but none the less i dont want 22 to start telling pepole about it and have major compatitionget there hopes up hey so i was watching the news this morning and u thought you might find this interestinghttpwwwcbccamrichnewsstory20101230healthtobaccowarningshtml and then just to be contradictory vancouver hands out lighters to stop violencehttpwwwnews1130comnewslocalarticle162995vpdusinglighterstofightviolenceagainstwomen 
wow i guess that shows you how much thet have given up on vancover already and i feel if the canadian goverment were serious about the smoking they would out law it them 
yeah but you have to look at it from a party stand point pc isnt outlawing it because of the votes but they believe its unjust liberals wont touch the topic and the ndp there leader in because is a pot activist 
yeah they also get a ton of cash from the ciggeret compainies because of taxes so i guess you can understand why they dont 
ndp did 
no the canadian government does hey travis on the peace bus registration form they ask a question what would be a fun 255 hour activity or project to do what do they mean 
there is 2 questions like that one is asking what activity youd do with the group of people on the bus when your in freddy that incorporates the peace bus ideals see power point other one is like what would be something fun that you all can do while your in fredericton i put stuff like kayak visit fundy 
so for the first one just a random activity my brother said you called but i dont have your number atleast i dont think i do what is up do u need something 
hey man what upso 2 thing pumped for maine yet haha who you driving down withand how is the joint partner ship on national camp coordinator

okay thanks for trying hey man could i borrow your shotgun microphone tomorrow i want to film the cherry orchard

aright ill be over at like 1 and richard will be there too 
cool make sure you bring my memory card too hey man could we film an interview with that bhutanese lady on friday at lunch

it is taking forever to export every thing is good but it doesnt have the name placards i guess we will just have to go without and use this one 
could we make another version later with the names 
yea like for when we show it sure

hey i just set it up sorry i took so long 
no problem hey daniel i sent you and clare an email about the site speed and the error message that i keep receiving i know you two split so that she would be handling more of the back end stuff but if shes too busy it would be wonderful if you could take a look as i said in the email will knows that were having this issue so hed be happy to talk to you if you need a hand let me know what you and clare work out by the way hows your summer going i personally cant believe how quickly these months have gone by 
hey julia i spent a couple of hours tonight working on the site speed no great improvements were made but it seems like decreasing the loading time maybe a gradual process i havent looked into the 502 error all that much i will talk to will in a couple of days if i feel that i am not making enough headway i think that claire will be working on the 502 error and i will work on site speed the 502 error maybe correlated to site speed but there are other changes regarding site speed that need to be addressed my summer is going really well busy but fun i know what you mean seems like winter exams were yesterday 
amazing thanks so much daniel i appreciate you putting the time into it i think will was working on site speed for most of the year so yeah quite a gradual thing what are you up to youre at home right

that must be a cool experience is there a big web team there i was moving around a bit at the start but now im in calgary doing an internship with a healthcare research centre im doing communications work 
the web team is like 5 people so its pretty small compared to a big company its nice because i am able to learn about the front and back end thats really cool do you like it

hm i only know how to express myself through food this is hard 
make a pizza 4 everyone and put in their envelopes 
mm greasy thats an option do you watch girls 
yea do u 
i havent seen the latest season or all of season 4 so kind of haha ive always felt so conflicted about it 
yea i also feel kinda conflicted about it i feel like i have a love hate relationship with the show in general 
yeah cause sometimes it just makes me feel so shitty haha fun fact i attended the girls discussion despite not watching any of the 6th season despite the finale 
haha haha really it didnt show at all 
wow used despite twice bad editing i was conveniently silent when everyone was discussing the rest of the 6th season haha it was confusing 
haha 
are you in toronto natalie was wondering cause shes bringing aprils warm and fuzzies back but didnt know whether to take yours 
yeah i am 
ah cool 
thanks 
im reading audreys transcript of the girls thing and we had to cut lots and lots for space but some of your quotes that got cut are gold i think there are a lot of things that are okay in lena dunhams mind that are okay in like literally no one elses

haha true 
hey what code editor would you recommend for someone trying to learn things i need to make a website with a portfolio and i want to make it nice but i only know very basic web design at the moment 
i use sublime its kind of bare bones tho i think that there may be a better one that finds errors as you write but i dont know there are a lot of really good web development courses online by the way check out code academy if you havent already 
ah okay i actually downloaded sublime last night cause my friend recommended it seems like its one of those where you need to add features yourself and i dont know how to do that i have been using codeacademy its very good so far 
yea sumblime kinda sucks in that sense if you google sublime package controll it should show you how to add the thing that lets u add features 
hey youalrighty mia is moving soon and i was wondering if you would be down for like a surprise going away party

maybe i do have an nused room if he wants it 
do you still not have internet at your place

15mps 40 
yo do u want 2 do thing where by the end of july me u and chris and shawn if he wants all have 2 write our own screen play chris is down 
i am totally down has chris told you about our tv pilot does the screenplay have to be original 
yes and yes 
whats your screenplay about 
kid who runs against his step dad for city council what about you 
group of male friends and their dating lives its a romantic comedy 
haha cool is it called entourage 
haha far from it its going to be good i think way better than that awkward moment im trying to take some inspiration from 500 days of summer on how best to write a comedy 
that sounds good do u know what chris is writting 
not yet do you know 
no i have no clue i think i am going to write the outline for mine tonight 
same ive been writing down ideas all day and i need to organize them i still want to work on the tv pilot a little too during this month i dont want to ignore it now that ive got it going 
yea that makes sense i am excited to see how that turns out 
i want to finish a draft before i return home chris can be involved as much as he wants to on it but hell probably be focusing on the screenplay now also shawn asked me this on friday but what does chris do allday 
he goes to library most days and studies for lsats he was trying to find a job but i think he has all but given up on that 
interesting so hes looking to get into law school next fall 
yea fall of 2017 i think 
his lsat score are going have to be top notch to get in somewhere where is he thinking of attending 
i think it is basically anywhere that will take him 
yeah glad hes giving it a try 
yea i am not sure how good his odds are time will tell i guess how are things at the cfl 
yeah hes going to have improve his gpa to get a better chance maybe retake certain classes and get a killer lsat at the very least in 95 percentile job is going well some tasks are boring and mundane but overall its pretty good cuddy just got back yesterday after he was away for 6 weeks on medical leave or something 
shit do u know what happened to him 
stomach surgery or something he seems fine now 
do u have any summer vacation plans 
not really i might just take all of december off i get 10 days of vacation so ill push it to then 
oh that would be cool 
i have sick and personal days also so if i need them ill use them not sure what ill do in december just come back home for the full month or stay in toronto for the first 2 weeks or maybe just peace to the caribbeans for 2 weeks and rent an apartment through airbnb

what room u in random errorat times it was unclear if the image was focused or not on the screen this issue was far more apparent when using both the concave and convex lenses at the same time which lead to a wide margin in error in reading from the meter stick roughly 3cm light interference from other groups light sources due to the width of the lens clamp rings the lenses could be place in the center of the clamp or off of the center point the clamps also did not ensure the lens was vertical systematic errorthe lens clamp obstructed the view of the numbers on the meter stick trial 1 in fig 12 is omitted because the image formed of the screen was a double image the data readings were also affected by parallax due to the configuration of the equipment precision measures meter stick you like what you see

i wasnt there for a lot of it it was mostly abbey and cassidy who were with her when she was crying but i think the general idea was that she was just sad because the last time you guys were at my house partying things were different i think she was just nostalgic oh and i think she was bothered by the fact that dejon came to pick you up too 
watta dick

i dont know 
i would think that they would want to see him and therefore pay for his trip 
haha yeah jack has always seemed kinda distant from his family

its just how he says shit like i cant wait to get my own place and never go back to fredericton 
haha fuck fredericton is nice i dont know why people hate it so much 
parts are good 
yes 
i think it has to do more with people wanting to leave the place they were born 
what u planning on doing this summer yea i think so want something new i wasnt born in fredericton tho 
im mean freddy is like an objectively nice place

she seems to trust amar bhardwajs intellect more than mine 
he is indian after all 
true unb is so easy i dont understand how anyone will fail 
dude she just doesnt want to admit that you are smarter than her has she fail anything 
dont think so wouldnt be surprised tho

man its gonna be pretty close on election night i hope harper wins so that ben harper doesnt lose his friends at queens 
pretty excited for election night im hosting the local conservative viewing party at my house so keith ash field will be there 
nice dude if keith wins then harper is going to pay from him to get dentures are jenny and dong gonna vote 
yeah jenny is voting conservative and dong is voting liberal pretty weird for jenny to be voting right winged considering that she has extreme left views 
haha that makes no sense she probabily just thinks harper is hot yo when is you are reading week

haha i dunno hes a stinky guy haha when i go into a study room with just the two of them all i smell is his stank 
haha speaking of stank did u hear stanko and chester left queens and are now attending med school in serbia 
yeah i heard haha stanko had 17 gpa at queens 
haha 
and chester had plagerisation on his transcript 
i heard about that 
haha plagiarized twice 
man those two fuckers glad they are now longer in canada their dad was probably exported due to malpractice 
dad moved back to serbia haha fuck have you ever heard of the university of novi sad i searched it up barely has online prescence 
me and ro chen looked it up the other day looks borderline fake yo do u see riyan ofen 
it looks like one of those med school scams on facebook yeah i do i go to the engineering lounge often 
is she still dating george 
no haha they hate each other 
haha y 
haha they are both very easy to hate 
yea true 
i hate djorde more than raiyan

he is so narcissistic i hate it so condescending at least raiyan knows that shes shit 
yea that very true do u have class with him 
no thank god hes nice to me tho but i still hate him lol 
haha man have u how sneha did on her mcat i see her everywhere

oh what a dumb fuck 
kk 
look at freddys comment 
jesus haha watching the republican debate its ludicrous even for a young conservative like me these guys are extremists 
haha man how is trump doing 
surprisingly not speaking a lot his ideas are ridiculous and reasonable like he wants to build a wall but his economic policies are very progressive surprisingly fucking ben carson is proposing a 15 flat tax rate 
ben carson is maybe one of the weirdest people in the world he is one of the best surgeons in usa and yet he is entirely confused when it comes to politics 
its ridiculous yeah haha apparently he had anger problems when he was younger almost stabbed his friend in an argument and then he found god and then never felt angry again thats why he is so weirdly calm now 
haha man that party is a fuck fest 
a bunch of fucking lunatics so delusional 
watching at tess what does ted  think 
ted  is snickering at almost everything and calling them out on their economic policy lies 
haha man it is fucked that the real election is a year away 
haha yeah i agree much different than canadas 76 day election campaign period so much money spent especially these republicans 
yea dude it would be really interesting to see one of them run in canada 
haha canadians would not accept any of them although they are all pretty well spoken 
yea thats the surprising thing 
man karim is ridiculous 
haha what happened 
what the fuck is that lol 
haha what the fuck dude 
haha what does that even mean 
i wonder if they found out about elise 
lol thats probably it when do you come back again i think tess is excited to see you guys

we were talking about how we should go crush a few brewtemders at christmas haha 
fuck ye dude have u met josh girlfriend yet 
haha not yet but ive met her when karim was messing around with her how long do u think this one will last haha 
if u based it on his past a month tops but i dont know maybe she is a good fit 
lol we said that with anna standing best of luck to them 
haha yea dude well see how are karim and elise going 
no idea lol i never see karim he is always with elise im pretty impressed with them honestly seeing that they cant touch and stuff 
they cant toouch 
no haha they cant touch 
y muslim stuuff 
yeah haha muslim stuff i dont think shes allowed in the house either 
jesus haha what a fucking lame deal 
yeah haha good for elise i guess but i heard from the grapvines that elise is one horny horny girl maybe she will crack and seduce him haha 
haha yea dude elise is only dating krim for that bbc 
lol hopefully karim will come out of his cave during christmas becuase ive only hung out with him like twice this year

lol my thoughts exactly lol raiyan just messaged dejon why do you hate richard what a fucking twat 
lol why did she do that 
haha raiyan was talking about dejon being back for christmas and i said dejon fucking hates me 
man why does anyone spend time with raiyan so toxic 
lol tanya is friends with her but i bet you that tanya will ditch her the moment people come back for christmas vinson lee is thinking of taking econcomp sci at mcgill he might be messaging you just a heads up 
haha that cool all of my fucking fans love me 
so much that they want to copy your degree wow thats incredible 
yea dude im famous man i got tanya 4 for the secret santa and have no idea what 2 get her 
haha jesus christ get her a new attitude 
haha whats wrong with her 
nothing wrong just crazy 
haha still jealous 
jealous im jealous of tanya right 
haha no imean she is a jealous person but yea you are jealous that you are not as close to riyan 
fuck raiyan 
lol man has she not fail out of engineering yet 
she probably wont but do you know who definitely will at the end of this term 
krim 
no haha aidan bullock karim works hard 
haha oh yea i heard about how he is doing really shit is he civil 
7 on a must pass lab exam not sure lol do you know why hes doing engineering lol 
no i mean he probably just picked so he could get a job he seems kinda dumb to be honest 
haha i know why 
oh shit y 
its because he wants to make guitars 
hahahahaahah what the fuck 
haha not kidding you 
just a basic lack of understanding what a fool 
he is just confused lol he should not be in university he should be in trade school or something 
lol ya 
would suit him much better 
is he gonna drop out of university 
he will fail out no doubt 
how does that even work 
if your gpa is lower than 15 or something you are not allowed to continue 
lol i hope that happens to the cocky dude from ohs in you are math classes 
lol me too but i think hes getting cs hes actually really nice to me but i still hate the fucer fucker just saw dejon and joli at the gym 
lol did u say hi 
yeah it was awkward though because a week ago raiyan had messaged dejon asking her why she hated me also dejon had a shit ton of makeup on 
haha u should have challenged dejon to a lift off 
i should have screamed dejon you fat fuck how long is she back for 
i dont know a while i think her breaks are really long 
ah fuck you still talk to her and all that good stuff 
lol ye she doesnt hate me yet 
haha she wont it would be fucking funny if she did i wonder what the reason would be 
haha a very unpredictable person lol when is you are next exam 
tomorrow but theres bad weather here so it s unpredicatable how about you 
like it might get moved 
yeah it might get moved to january i hope it will more time to study for java

lol its you are fucking car 
ya i know i realised after u left 
open the apartment door 
lunch 
mahdi not replying so prob not save some money 
first time i have seen u make a responsible financial decision good work buddy 
i feel like this is patronizing 
not at all buddy 
are you upset 
i am crying at my desk 
we can talk about this instead of being passive aggressive you know 
hey no problem over here buddy 
we dont have enough criminals for tonight 
how many do we have 
we have chris tess mahdi 
tangs 
they cant until 8 
fuck 
chris has to leave then 
yea we could film his shit 
you are little bro we need everyone there for those establishing shots tho 
hm true what about tomorrow night 
i dont wanna reschedule i can ask but 
could we get liam 
that means we shoot the scraps tn liam has work until 9 
k we will shoot the kidnapping scene 
ill ask them if they are free did you write 
and me and karims 
those scenes before the warehouse scene 
maybe we should skip those 
you think kk 
yea it will be fine 
i think we should shoot them or else it climaxes too fast 
no it will be fine 
i dont think so man it will go from tanyas scene straight to guns and warehouse 
well it starts with us talking 2 j mac and then we chase him in 
alright meet at my house 645 tn bring you are bro 
chris 
yea for the kidnapping 
lol kk wait 
what 
shoundnt it be the tangs because we show him with the tangs 
maybe they switched cars i dont know because we cant get the tangs until 8 dont forget karims shit 
man so many inconsistencies 
do you have a solution 
we could push the release or shoot a scene of the transfer 
i dont think this inconsistency is bad because double dutch has many henchmen maybe they just delivered it to him i mean theyre all going to end up in the warehouse so itll make sense 
are u going to be in the car that does the kidnapping 
i think we should not show me because that scene with the tangs has that reveal when i turn around 
yea 
i think this should just be a fast kidnapping scene 
kk then it will be fine 
hey i think were good tn 
what u mean 
chris can film till whenever 
wag 
we can do everything tn dont forget chris lutes 
my bro cant come

lol no bus kk i booked 
dope hows life on you are own by the way 
pretty good very poor lost 10 lbs 
haha why are u poor 
haha i dont know rent no money saved up eating a lot of cereal and bread 
haha shitty man pulll an abbey get you are parents to open a credit card 4 u 
haha does she have that 
ahahyea where do u think she gets her money from 
lol bad part is that shes not going to make any money either later in life 
haha man once you mentioned that u were gonna apply to the job for the nb pension plan or what ever and you said that the starting slary was 100k and she said to me damn i am not gonna be making that amount till im in my late 20s 
haha what world is she living in i honestly hope to god 
graphic design are extremely sought after 
that she does not think like that or that her life is on that track she must know that artists starve 
httpwwwpayscalecomresearchcajobgraphicdesignersalary 41 k median 
thats for the people who actually manage to get a graphic designer job she better hopes she marries rich 
i dont think that will happen 
she fucked hows you are classes 
pretty shit to be honest i am taking calculus 3 its so boring and first year physics my comp classes are good same with my econ class what about you 
lol nice im taking too many classes too late to drop so im gonna have to grind it out 
what are they 
but theyre chill real analysis complex analysis number theory stats econometrics intro finance corp finance 7 courses 
haha damn thats a shit tone what the fuck is analysis i always hear people talk about it 
its just like once youve moved beyond learning calculus calculus is a tool for learning real and complex analysis which is just a bunch of theories and proofs one course focuses on the real numbers and another course on the complex plane 
haha is it good sounds kinda fucked 
yeah real analysis is prob my hardest course too abstract for me 
yea sounds like it how are the business classes 
easy as fuck barely a degree like high school all over again you should look at the business students schedules 
no class friday there too 
yep lol liam and chris think they have it so fuckin tough too its ridiculous 
haha man business people who complain are so fucking out of touch rachel complains about how hard her work is liams life is getting easier tho heard he broke up with tanya 
dont think that actually hapenned its fucked tanya told me they broke up liam didnt say a word they still hanging out pretty sure 
lol do u think she is lying 
no i think they broke up and then got back together liam didnt say a word about it 
oh shit when did she tell u they broke up 
i see that guy everyday way more than i see tanya 
also not surprised he didnt tell you 
she told me last friday just texted me out of nowhere 
he is a pretty closed off guy 
hes talked about his relationship before when drunk anyway they will break up for sure soon its just a matter of time 
i dont know man we said that last summer too 
they hang out like once a week so theyre barely going out 
yea thats true 
liam does whatever he wants and tanyas upset that he doesnt hang out with her so then at the end of the day tanya is really the one who is worked up about it and i dont give a shit about tanya so 
haha yea she is really fucked up jack was telling me that she lied to him all summer long 
haha yeah she is preema sarkar v2 whats up with these indians eh 
youre telling me have u guys been going to triva since i left 
nope haha havent seen much of chris either 
yea he was studying surprisingly hard for his lsat and then he left for ontario 
nice alright dude i gotta sleep have 830 tomorrow night 
haha kk peace 
little do people know aprox 15 minutes after this seemingly carefree video we would be committing the class e felony of hitting wagners car

i dont think so 
but im not feeling like gettting lit w a bunch of randoms tn ya feel

i would consider doing it if i didnt feel shitty and i have a weekend of drinking at queens also today is a sad day 
why 
mainly v sad for ma boy obama 
haha man though u would be happy 4 trump considering the fact that you are a proud young conservative 
haha trump is not a conservative trump is a huge bigot with no care or knowledge in true conservative values

yup do you want all 8 
yes please 
briefly describe the punic wars and their significance to rome 
thank you so much 
hey 
is that the equivalent to like a javadoc site 
i dont think so but im not familiar with javadoc its similar the first site is an excellent and short reference the second is aptly named the complete reference so 
okay sweet yeah i have kinda been jumping around with languages i started with c then java then as3 but i really like c are you doing computer science next year 
no i wouldnt learn anything on a related note i think c is actually super fun and i dont at all think pointers are awful man traps so do you want to partner for the competition 
no i cant go but do plan on going next year i wish i had know about it before like yesterday 
i know right i hate the school for this bull shit i was never told about the exam to skip a year in math there were two math competitions i could have done and now this rhjetrjyetyj tyjwry etyuk 
it kills me i was so excited to hear about it and suprised to see other programmers our age do you know what alex or daniel he does 
i was just talking to daniel sasy he cant go i dont have alex on facebook 
well they said that you can preform solo if you wanted to 
i know but i want toi at least try to din a partner before applying find 
haha yeah does seshu do any programing 
no and apperantly no one else does either im gonna ask the cs teacher about her students tomorrow then apply based on that 
yeah i know the 11 graders do basic and 12th does java im am doing 12 next year bescause i heard basic sucks 
well i wouldnt know but it looks really simple not worth wasting an elective 
yea what electives did you take 
math fnd 110 english 112 precalc chem 111 phys 11 111 um powertrain and chassis music instr i think thats it 
are you doing chem or phys in french 
they werent offered level 1 in french so i was forced to take them in english but i took jistory in french 
did u take lvl1 history in french 
no level 2 i didnt take engineering or history in level 1 too much work for nothing 
haha so do u plan on doing cs in university 
absolutely my goal is to make an is i have made one before but it didnt do anything except beep unitl the machine was foribly turned off 
lol are you interested in any apple stuff like apps 
well i have a lovehate thing with apple 
haha being 
they brought unix to the uneducated public but they have double standards everywhere for example they said no fart apps but the app store manager made and maintins a really disgusting one not only that i hate is x i can hardly use it no customization at all 
do you have a mac 
my mom had one i use linux actually best is ever 
really 
hard to tell huh 
becasue its open source 
well that and its blazingly fast and has way better software management foe example on windoze you go online and look for an installer in linux the community makes programs that go through a screening commitee and then theyre uploaded to a big repopsitory i dont search online for programs and all the programs are upadted all at once check oh this website httpubuntucomapps 
do u like all the updates at the same time 
this shows all the applications you find in the app store on ubuntu yes a little inwodw pops up every now and then and says stufff like system updates 3 software updates 17 optional 8 
404 page not found 
i just hit update and enter my password oh hold on corno sent you a private messagesubject re lyrics wow what a nice surprisethe same songit is summer and its truethat the sky is blue for youi wont cry and i wont begi wont lie i wont let you go awaywithout feeling my underground heartno i wont let you go awaywithout beatin with my underground heartcall meendlesslywith a name you like to know mewe feel freeas long as wesing the same songthe same songyou come closerring the bellits your face my loving graceyou wont cryand you wont begyou wont lie you wont let me close the doorwithout feeling your underground heartno you wont let me close the door without beatin with your underground heartcall meendlesslywith a name you like to know mewe feel freeas long as wesing the same songthe same songyou can not expect a break here cause this song is for lovers for the good ones with a good heart whoops httpsappsubuntucomcat 
lol what 
sorry httpsappsubuntucomcat didnt clear my clipboard when i open up the software center it looks like the app store except over 99 is free go on youtube and search for videos of ubuntu usage im using the most recent 1204 io tihnk 
can you get the normal adobe applications 
well that all depends a lot of companies dont make their sofwatre for linux because not many people use it compared to apple and windoze adobe and itunes arent available but a lot of games are again you can see it all on that site i linked and you can actually installe a program that can run windows apps its called wine i use it to run portal 2 but itunes doesnt work with it 
well i do hate itunes 
i know right unforunatle for me i have the ipod the open source community didnt figure out how to uplaod music to yet so im still waiting for one of the open source programs to have compatibility for it then i can erase windwos completely 
i also hate how apple have their own video file type as soon as there was a vlc they took it down 
i know 
that kills me i feel like apple is very caught up image and lacks in most other fields 
if youre interested i have my ubuntu cd you can try ubuntu without changing anything on your computer ill give it to you at school exactly ive been trying to phrase it for years but ubuntu well there are different types of linux ubuntu is the most popular it focuses more on image than the others but it also keeps up with the other fields it looks really cool actually i havent had a single problem since i strated using linux it works fine with my hardware no bugs if im not trying the experimentla stuff 
what kind of processor do u have 
intel core i3 and i can run iuntense fps no problem never had alg 
laptop 
yes 
hp 
no acer but techinically gateway my motherboard was changed awhile back 
yeah i have hp with a i3 and its awful 
dude you will be so impressed with linux on it no lag at all ive never had anything take more than a quarter of a second to laod its crazy right now i have about twelve different programs open no lag 
shit how can i get it 
well there are inctruction at ubuntucom and i can give you my installation disk i wont need it again i can give you somegood tips too for example 
will i have to give up any of my programs 
no not even which windows are you using 
7 
okay do you have admin priviliges basically if you want to keep windows but also have ubuntu you have to separate your hard disk into partitions 
what do you mean of my own laptop 
ive been through all this before well your hard disk is separated into sectins not physically just in the way your computer writes to it these sections are called partitins if you click the start button right click on my computer hit manage then go down to disk management youll see what i eman you should have a big c block a 100mb system reserved block and an hp factoryiomage kind of thing if you want to install ubuntu properly you have to create a new block for it by making the c block smaller and creating a new one its pretty complicated 
i have a 103 mb hptools 
but id be glad to help its worth the trouble okay but do you see what i mean tho your hard disk is in partitions 
waht is hp factoryiomage 
what i suggest well when windows stops working 
yeah i see it now 
some manufacturers have a recovery partitrion that they use to restory your computer to the original state what i suggest actually and we can go to the tech lab why dont you meet me at lunch tomorow and ill show you i can actually install it to my usb and use that 
that would be sweet 
alright where do you want to met 
library 
okay do you want me to go straight there or are you eating lunch first 
how long does it take 
depends i have two versions of ubuntu and older one which i customized and ill bring my cd which has the newer version 
does 12 45 work 
anyway the cd is really slow tho ill get that all ready for tomorrow im actually gonna go to bed now ive been sleeping late recently 1245 is good but i wont have time for the cd do you want me to isntall the new cversion on my usb 
if it wouldnt be too much trouble 
its not i can get it ready in about 10 minutes anwyay ill see you tomorrow then 
awesome see ya 
okay your not on 
hey mahdi i am going to montreal in november we should hang

alicia is really busy and max is really lazy its a perfect combo s 
why arent new people coming innnnnn is liam chase coming back

yeah man nobody can play it like you um i think almost 60 people most of the will be small kids though deniz wont come cause he has to go to istanbul for a competition tomorrowi dont know what is it about so ill be the only one who know the game d 
haha thats sweet so are u planing on doing anything for cisv this year 
i want to be junior councillpr but my school will be over 2 weeks later then then the other schools and after that ill go to the usa ill get back from there probably at the 3rd of july but the camp will start at the 28th of june however we dont have any invitation besides turkey so i can only be junior councillpr in turkey this year and the camp will be in my school and its almost 1 km to my home think about that im just 1 km far from my home and i cant see my parents what the fuck d next ill think about being junior councillpr this year maybe i can just help them if they need i love to make children happy and make fun of with them d 
haha i want to be a junior councillpr too but another guy in fredericton wants to do it too so i dony know if ill get picked so i may apply for an iym in france 
man there is 4 more guys want to be junior councillpr too d i dont know maybe i may do iym too 
where is your iym going 
actually i have no idea d cause its not certain yet 
oh so how did your fall camp go 
what do you mean about fall camp 
you said you were having a welcome back camp 
oh okay i got it haha it was awesome we talked about our camps and memories played lots of games i just loved chinese masters i was a master and only one group could find me others were suck d and we have a project about establishing turkish njr and junior board turkey we will have meetings to make our project real i would love to be the turkish ijr p 
you dont have a junior board in turkey 
we had but it didnt work as the leader said to me also they said that they didnt have the potential to do it d but this year we have potentials im one of them d so we are going to do it again and it will work 
thats amazing i would vote for you how long has cisv been in turkey 
almost 40 years i think but its my first year d 
oh wow well i guess it is about time you have a junior board 
40 years is too late it had to be long time ago but anyway im in it so that will be perfect 
yeah it is what are u going to be in the junior board 
man i dont know what junior board is at all some leaders told me that we will do it can you tell me please d 
the jbis like a group of kids that plan stuff for the rest of the kids in the city you also to fundraising and plan mini camps its really fun 
it sounds really fun well njr and junior board are similar things and you asked me that what am i going to be in the junior board what did you mean about that 
njr is national junoir representative so you would repressent cisv turkey and you get to go to an international meeting with other njrs junior board is more local so u work on things in turkey on the junior board there are different positions to do different jobs 
oh i see thank you for inspiring me d yeah there will be an international meeting in belgium i think so we will choose who will be the ijr and who will be njrs i can be the ijr cause 1 leader gave me as an example of the ijr while she were telling about the project and 2 leaders told me that i have to be junior councillpr this year in turkey man im the chosen one for that job d 
haha yeah good luck 
actually one of the leaders who thinks i have to be junior councillpr was like please be junior councillpr at the camp in turkey i really want to see here please stay with me she was like begging d hey man im thinking about to make you a birthday video with the terradacto style if i can get back home before saturday im gonna do that shit d 
haha that would be amazing

best laid plans is a politically satirical comedyfiction novel written by terry fall is it is a selfpublished novel that has won numerous awards including the 2008 stephen leacock medal for humour and the 2011 canada reads award fall is is a canadian writer who earned his bachelor of engineering degree at mcmaster university in hamilton ontario while attending the university he served as the president of the student union where he was able to gain some valuable albeit amateur political acumen this firsthand insight into the realm of politics was what enabled fall is to convey the political aspects of the book with such proficiency the best laid plans follows the uncannily disastrous yet humorously so adventures of daniel addison an exspeechwriter for the liberal leader and a loyal liberal himself who knows nuances of federal politics like the back of his placard tired of the never ending cynicism and cunning deceit that permeates the hill daniel attempts to escape the integrity crushing clutches of federal politics by resigning as the leaders speech writer and finding repose in the small quaint and egregiously rightwing town of  the only problem is that before he manages to leave the hill with a clear conscience daniel is given one last task to find and campaign for a liberal candidate for the  riding in the upcoming federal election a town that has not seen a liberal member of parliament since the dawn of man when daniel meets angus mclintock an eccentric engineering professor grammar pundit and parttime chess aficionado he thinks that he has found just the right name to put on the voting ballot in exchange for having to teach a despondent english course at a university filled to the gasket with hopelessly illiterate engineers in an uncanny turn of events however the heavily favoured longtime conservative mp of  eric cameron is exposed to the public as his true and unsightly self during the night before the election as a result angus chances of being elected quickly soar into the positives and the political worlds of  and even canada itself are about to be completely changed at the beginning of the best laid plans the reader is immediately introduced to daniel addison the easily relatable protagonist and hilariously sarcastic narrator of the book addison is described as a liberal and a liberal in that order fall is 9 he even served as the speech writer for the liberal leader before he attempted escape the world of politics addison is very well versed in the nuances of parliamentary ottawa and during his time there he is mercilessly subjected to the cynical influences of his fellow liberals this is evident form the quote one day you wake up and find youre instinctively reviewing polling data in a different way you find yourself thinking about the election cycle and how to isolate the weak cabinet minister from the rest of the herd in order to move in for the kill fall is 11 daniel mostly serves the purpose of providing facetious commentary on the events in the story as the story does not revolve directly around him his witty insight is an important part of the humour of the novel a good example of this is when daniel describes an angry persons face as morphing from panic pink to raging red to ballistic blue fall is 154 he then creatively complements this witty comment with a perhaps crayola had an opening for someone like me fall is 154 throughout the novel fall is develops the protagonist by having him realize the importance of using politics to serve society as a whole rather than to better ones own situation or cause this development is evident in the line wed like your jobs but not if it means spoiling our water and imperilling the lives of the workers fall is 259 daniels dialect in the story reveals that he is a very intelligent individual who is also a witty commentator the reader can infer these traits from the line their presence in some ultraconservative areas was tantamount to two unarmed nazis strolling through downtown london at the height of the blitz fall is 91 one can tell that he is intelligent from of his use of esoteric words such as tantamount and that he is witty from his simile about nazis daniel helps to develop the plot by convincing angus to run as the liberal candidate for  in order for him to fulfill his debt to the liberal leader this develops the plot because when angus unexpectedly wins the election his maverick tendencies cause conflict in the political world apart from daniel the other salient character in the story is angus mclintock a beneficent engineering professor whose values are the polar opposite of what is common on the hill his maverick tendencies can be inferred from the line i said no do you really believe it is in the national interest to pour tax payers money into an inefficient and outmoded factory so we can dump artificially in other countries and compete unfairly fall is 56 his purpose with regards to the plot is dual to cause conflict in the political world with his unorthodox views and also to serve as a catalyst for daniel to help him forget his cynical views on politics angus character traits can be inferred from his actions in the story for example when angus puts the wellbeing of other countries before his citys prosperity as aforementioned the reader can deduce that he is honest and caring for everyone in the story angus is described through the eyes of daniel which portrays him with a tone of awe this is partly because daniel is amazed at angus genuine yet successful approach to politics this tone of wonder is evident in the line i cant believe it but you did it you got the rusted government to do your bidding fall is 224 angus dialect most saliently reveals that he is of irish descent and proud of it for example the line i just cannae believe im enjoyin myself so fall is 259 exemplifies his retention of his indigenous vernacular this use of dialect really brings life to angus character angus develops the plot by having contrasting views with other more cynical liberals which consequently causes conflict in the house of commons apart from angus and daniel the other characters in the book are flat and do not develop throughout the story nor contribute significantly to the plot these include lindsay parkinson who is daniels love interest muriel parkinson who is the fivetime defeated liberal candidate for  and daniels advisor and petes 1 and 2 two students of daniels that help him run the liberal campaign in the best laid plans fall is use of daniels unique voice is an important part of the humour fall is frequently incorporates grammatical satire into the book through daniels voice a creative way to really bring the story to life one example is the line there is something very comforting about the fetal position i heard a soft moaning and spent a couple of minutes identifying the source it was me i mean i fall is 122 this line is significant because daniel constantly corrects the grammar of other less grammatically inclined people throughout the novel in this instance however his perplexity of the situation was shown through his ironic personal misuse of grammar a clever device implemented by fall is moreover the author added realism to the story through language by frequently using esoteric words such as clandestine fall is 127 and monolithic fall is 109 this is a reflection of daniels love for the english language and adds to the depth of his character another way that fall is adds to the story is through the use of political satire as a literary device for example the line rachel was on her knees in front of the opposition house leader lets just say she was rather enthusiastically lobbying his caucus fall is 14 is rife with political satire and euphemism this use of satire adds a great deal of value to the book for the readers that understand these clandestine allusions the main theme of the novel is the ability for one to separate oneself from the crowd for the greater good and to care for everyone this idealism is evident in angus ability to resist conforming to the cynical views of common politics and to act for the greater good an example from the text that supports this theme is in the line every candidate in this country should be thinkin first about the national interest second about their constituents interests and third about their own interests fall is 56 angus shows that he cares about the greater good more than his own person gain this theme is important because the entirety of the conflict in the book stems from angus opposing views moreover the protagonist daniel is also converted to these views through angus exercising of this tenet fall is develops this theme of societal wellbeing over individual gain by emitting it through angus character every single one of angus political manoeuvres is centered on this idealism angus characterization is closely related with the main theme of the story because his character is the paragon of this theme as stated in many aforementioned textual examples angus constantly incorporates this theme into everything he does thereby implementing it as an important part of his character the novels theme of caring for others over oneself is a universal one that is recurring throughout much of our worlds texts one good example is in the movie forrest gump where in one scene the protagonist runs and saves 5 of his comrades in the battlefield despite an impending air strike this exemplifies the need for caring for others and the greater good over caring for oneself as a result forrest was able to save the lives of 5 other soldiers rather than just escape with his own lifethe best laid plans is a very entertaining and unique read that is sure to please readers that possess even modicum of political knowledge it is a very funny novel with an engaging way of presenting itself through the intelligent eyes of daniel addison the reader becomes truly immersed in the world of canadian politics and feels as if they are really part of the experience some perks that come with reading the novel include a broadly expanded vocabulary and some basic knowledge of political operations on the other hand these perks could also be viewed as a downside because it might ostracize the readers who are not looking for an intense read where being able to read a whole page without having to access a dictionary is considered a spectacular accomplishment the novel comes with a host of memorable unique characters that really grow on the reader throughout the novel each characters unique personality and voice make them come to life the only dislike that a reader could potentially have with this novel is level of sophistication used in the diction and satire it does admittedly take a strenuous amount of effort to fully comprehend and enjoy all of the allusions in the text but it is worth it overall this is a quality piece of literature that is definitely worth a read and it is a sure recommendation to all that enjoy good laugh about canadian politics and some sophisticated satireworks citedfallis terry the best laid plans

send me it as a file 
okay how 
never mind u got mine 
yeah okay just copy and paste mine onto word and change the font 
okay i just read it it was well done good imagery and you support your ideas well with quotes but it seems like you need to filter your ideas all of the text is not nesscary and prescott will be not be happy having to read something that long winded intro is still too long but i love the conclusion 
lol fuck mrs prescott she can read my ass ha okay but yeah i dont know lol i am waay to tired and i guess the limit was 6 pages and i hit that exactly haha reading yours now hoenikker tells john about his fathers dyeing creation dying is spelled wrong although throughout the book we meet a plethora of different characters we is a personal pronoun rephrase to there are or there appear there is a plethora of characters the book is replete with characters filled to the gasket as a matter of fact 
anything else 
strong arguements space between paragraphs is not consistent with space between liens without explanation he uses words such as karass bokonon and grandfalloon words that were created for the book rephrease to without explanation he uses words that were created for the book such as karass bokonon and grandfalloon because you mention the subject twice which is awkward youll forget it when youre dead and so will i when im dead im going to forget everythingand i advise you to do the same vonnegut 96 no period after same the last punctuation is ommiteed dude this guy we must learn from him httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvbgdb4sjn0fs his puns are just off the brace of this earth surfs up and by the way are you done your business plan you guys start pressentation tomorrorw right 
yeah and i am not done 
shit haha me neither are you shooting for the competition 
i dont care 
suave what is the business you are doing 
body disposal 
why are you always so sarcastic 
do we have to respond to the comic for the assignment 
i dont know im too busy surfing right now 
funny guy 
not even im scanning the internet for reference articles for my music term paper and i actually dont know i didnt do the comic 
k also are u missing any quotes 
no i have all the quotes 
give me sum 
okay heres one its a competitive world bro surfs up lutes 666 
robert i will destroy you saw you studied until three last nigght 
no i only post statuses like that to make me seem academic so when harvard looks at my facebook theyll think im a good student 
big brother is watching 
probably 
give me a quote look at me boy 
dude are you planning on dorpping out of prescotts 
noare you 
no 
why do u ask 
a lot of people are and im just trying to get the general opinion 
who is switching other than karim 
i heard that guidance is going to talk to prescott cause they had so many people come ask them to switch out from our class im pretty sure stanko daniel he logan milne ainsely swift alicia colter mather mclaughlin and karim and maybe a few others 
who said that guidance was going to talk to her 
i dont know i just have that notion in my head i forget who said that 
pretty sure thats bullshit but i have heard that from others too why are people switching out 
everyones just switching out because they arent used to her hard amrking and they think they deserve a better mark in an easier course where they dont challenge themselves and waste their time ill admit that a better mark could be achieved in level two english and as far as helping you on paper this course is generally not as good as level two but im more in it for the self challenge and the experience 
yeah thats kinda stupid to switch for a higher mark they should all just do lvl3 
and also i think i can still pull off a good mark if i really pull my scuba googles up and sharpen my surfboard 
you probably wont hang 10 more like a 96 
its funny cause they apply for level 1 thinking that they are gifted or smarter but when they get challenged and have to work hard they drop out and criticize the teacher 
lol i dont really mind a smaller class 
she might have to merge the two classes together in semester two after everyone dorps out lol whats your mark in that class anyways or at least as of last report card 
89 which i am okay with 
okay 
how did u do on the chem test 
the mark or how i felt 
both i guess 
998 and pissed about the 02 percent 
sick bra 
how about you 
97 what was it out of 
100 most test are actually 
no i mean the test its self 
i forget lol whats your average in chemistry now 
93 
its actually such an easy course lol i thought it would be the hardest but tis not did you say you had a 98 average in that course didnt 
sarcasm 
why 
igtg see ya bra l8ta 
alligator dude chem answers are you done those 
no what sheet is it 
1227 
k ill do them now do we do it on the sheet 
i didnt 
what did u get for a 
i forget lol 
check 
isnt a one of the easy ones im not home right now 
k 
for a u find the moles and compare that with the molar ratio 
i wasnt there when she explained how to do this shit 
wait not even you just find the moles nmm use that whichever has less moles is the limiting reagent 
oh 
and you have to compare it with the molar ratiotoo 
would 150 atoms of mg 150 moles of mg 
for 1 the ratio is automatically 11 but if u have an equation u have to look at that yeah 
kk can you take a picture of the english home work for me 
what english homework what oh shit i forgot that 
lol 
okay ill post a picture are you done the chem yet 
just started im on 3 d 
okay 
you didnt show any work 
u dont have to 
what did she say that 
i dont think you have to show your work i am assuming hm hm okay i will redo it 
bad move 
but chceck the answers are they the same 
check 3 c and d 
u have different answers 
c 85g d 26g 
no my answer is right for c and probably d but i havent checked that yet you forgot to check if oxygen was a limiting reagent you have to use the mols of oxygen tio calculate the nitric oxide because there is an excess of ammonia 
c 45 080868 85g 
exactly wait what 
thats all it asks for 
thats not how you do it you take the grams of oxygen given divide by molar mass of oxygen multiply by 4 divide by 5 
im talking about c 
multiply by the molar mass of no yeah you cant use ammonia wait hold on sorry iwas looking at d lol 
fuck man read the question they dont even mention no in it 
i thought you were tallking about d okay what were your asnwers again 
85g and d was 26g 
dude so its 681704 5 4 16 for c 
u sure 
well look at the reasoning 681704 is moles of ammonia 54 is the moles of oxygen 16 is the mass of oxygen 
fuck you are logic 
how did you logic 
the ratio is 4 to 5 54 125 68 85 
the flaw is is that mass is not porportional moles or proportional its not saying that oxygen weighs 54 as much as ammoni its saying there are 54 as many moles of oxygen as ammonia kahpeash

compare my pp likes to yours 
you should put that on your college application this escalated quickly but do you see the logic no 
why didnt you do 4 678 10 11 
they wernt assigned 
sweet 
so have you rechecked over c and d 
che i got now 
u got now 
ye wow how did u get 180g for 5 
i recalculated and its correct hg is the lr 049 mol 11 mol ratio 049 mhgbr2 mhgbr2 is the molar mass of mercury bromide 
hg10g br29g how is hg the lr 
as i said mass is not the roportional factor mols ar 10g of hg is 049 mol 9g of br2 is 056 mol 
k but that doesnt explain the 180g it should be 18g 
why the limiting sig fig is 900 thats 3 sig figs 
k you did 12 a wrong 
is it 20 g is that the asnwer 
i got 21g well 209g 
its 1 sf 9 g 
yeah that it 
21 has 2 sf the answer is either 20 or 30 209 is closer to 20 
no shit 
so the answer is 20 no 21 my answer was right 
ye 
everything checks out 
yes now can u send me the la homework

they say it is in 202 but it isnt really 
theres no looping thing shouldnt it be like until there are no people uncounted but is that implied by the meaning of the word each idkkk 
the loop is for each person in room i guess is basically really shitty pseudo code 
aighttt so im gonna put it is an algorithm but this one isnt right they are three laws to the robotics1 a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm2 a robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law 3 a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law because there is no goal it doesnt accomplish anything its just laws

ya 
yea its has very specific applications 
yo im taking comp 230 instead man wanna league tn dilk 
no cant tonight when i get back though 
kk alright lol this quiz is just hard enough to make coel storey feel smart but just easy enough to make coel storey still feel smart httpswwwwomencomshannonquizonlypeoplewithiqrange140149knowthemeaningofthese17words 
haha a good way to describe coel 
lol did you try to quiz did you get 100 einstein 
yea man i got 100 i guess having the vocab of a 13 year old makes me a genius 
jesus hes done this quiz multiple times 
haha 
you think hell ride this shtick all the way to mla board of directors 
haha man i hear is resume is just a copy of the results of the test 
yyo i have a coding question 
lol kk sup 
is there a way to automate like entering searches into a website and then also recording the results in like a csv or excel 
ye 
like we essentially have a list of names in excel and we wanna search them all on rocket reach its a website which finds emails to names and then we want all the emails in excel like would that be a hard thing to implement 
if anyone in you are group know python it wouldnt be hard 
could you do it 
haha im busyyy 
we could pay you its for jed my project 
haha how muchhhh 
how many hours would it take you well im not sure how hard a task is so i dont know whats fair haha 
4 prob 
like how long would you guess 
wait when do u need it for 
hm maybe by end of next week 
kk yea it just depends on how much 
20 per hour you said 4h so 80 80 flat regardless of how many hours tho 
hm yea sure yo do you have the login shit for rocket 
ya we do do you know how to webscrape 
yea 
you missed a call from robert you missed a call from robert 
in library 
is it easy to webscrape all linkedin names with the skill nursing educator so basically we need to search on linkedin all names with nursing education as a skill which we tested and works 
wait is this different from rocket search 
then we need to scrape all those names and also their city or some other property into excel then we wanna rocket search all of those names and save down all of the emails is that doable 
ah kk so you have the list of nursing educators 
so we need to webscrape them if you linkedin search nursing education and press people with nursing education as a skill we want all of the search results that pops up so thats like using a webscraper to import that right 
yea 
oh kk but ya would that be a hard thing to do too 
it isnt really hard conceptually its just time consuming 
oh kk true i coul dprobably figure out the scrape thing but the list of names to rocket reach thing can you do that just use a filler list of names for now 
yea sure what day do u need it by 
dope dope friday you down to agree lock in let me know asap 
like today or next friday 
next friday lol you in montreal still 
yea kk ill lock in 
kk nice you down to league today 
no im leaving soon to go to the states 
yo actually we ran into a problem rocket reach only has around 200 searchs per month and we wanna search like 1m emails so we might try a different approach 
ahahaah kk let me know 
hey dan wait for me dog 
in game right now next one tho 
yes you missed a video chat with robert hey reach my base for league

sorry i dont i havent taken notes yet in that class 
lol okay do you know anyone who would that i could message 
ash might take notes also anders is in that class too i think 
okay thank you 
hey have you done the web work yet i need help with a question 
yup come on up to 603 
im not in rez right now its this question the f0 is right but the two limits are wrong 
just divide the functions by x 
oh thanks 
its sort of a trick he explained it today no problem 
hey is the webwork called ass4 optional dont see why it is there 
it is not optional and it is due tomorrow found that out today p 
weird do you know why there are two due in a row 
cause hes a dick 
haha also has he said anything about making the final worth 85 rather than 55 
he hasnt i dont think anyone has asked though this is his first semester at mcgill so you have to explain all these things 
okay haha i think i may talk to him good luck on the assignment talk to you later 
okay you too when you get 1 would you mind screenshotting me your answer cause i keep getting it wrong and i dont know if its a formatting thing or what 
the question about the shadow 
yea 
here 
i guess i have been overthinking it haha 
did u have the same numbers 
nope 
do u know how to get the answer 
i guess not s would you mind explaining it 
sure ill take a picture of my work and send it one sec 
thank you so much are you all done 
nope just did the first 2 questions 
oh okay im working on it now if you want to meet up im done 3 4 5 
its okay im still on campus and am planning on putting it off for awhile lol 
so is it just 3 chain rules 
yeah i think so 
have you been able to crack 7 
yeah 
can you share your wisdom please 
can u screen cap the question i kinda guess not really sure how it works ll 
lol if it works it works 
try 916 i think that should work 
nope 
hm how many attempts do u have left on the question 
8 
o kk try 34 
yes can you try my friends too haha sqrtx sqrty 8 and y436 find y4 
yeah it will be 3 i think 
so what is your method or are you just a wizard that worked 
lol implicit diff the first equation then u get y sqrtyx the x value is just the number in brackets and the y value is whatever yx equals 
hm you make it sounds easy could you send pictures of your work for 9 and 10 weve been working on them for like an hour p 
still havent done them yet ill let you know when i finish them prob tomorrow 
okay hopefully we will get them before then hey so i figured out 9 but if you have 10 i would be super grateful 
i havent looked at it yet but ill let you know if i solve it 
i got it if you need it 
yeah that would be great cant solve it 
okay so the first line is what youre working with where i have 5 you type in your own number that is the x value in the 0 point so mine was 50 then you input your x and y values from the other coordinate given and rearrange and solve for dydx which is m 
what was the other point given in the question 
well i had two points one was 5 0 and the other was 34 
okay thanks for the help 
no problem 
i dont get question 10 at all 
you can do this okay just give me your numbers and i will see what i can do 
lol my i have 50 and 22 
try 150579003 
for m 
yes 
nope 
try 06773172948 
nope 
fucker 067732 120220622348 or that 
nope in you are work how do u get 6dydx for the second half of the equaiton 
i dont even remember but i ended up not using that i just plugged the numbers into the formula using wolfram alpha which i am trying to do now but it isnt cooperating 0859513

sorry d what can i do they cannot resist also if you like it then like it you already did 
haha deniz the turkish player d haha 
so you are sophmore this yaer i dont know if i spell it right which means 2nd year of high school right 
yeah but we dont call it that here that is an american thing we say tenth grade it sucks 
excatly we also say 10th grade too we dont have names for years but you know your curriculum is much easier a ninth grader in turkey can easily get a 700 in sat at math part 
shit man some kids in my class today had to ask how to divide its crazy kid dont really care here thats why the good students have to study their own stuff 
what how to divide you dont wanna know what we learn in 10th grade or in hisgh schoool at all because its really complicated 
haha i wish it was like that here but insted we do stupid shiti hate my school i am trying to get my parent to let me study abroad next year 
slow down to start with you dont want this because we try to learn everything and 90 percent of them is unnecessary for life we just learn it for university enterance exams and what do you do at school why do you hate it 
haha at my school we cant take advanced classes untill grade 11 so i have to wait i want to be a politician or economist 
wow dont really know waht to say about it but again good luck with everything hope you do the best 
haha so do enter university they only look at an exam mark and thats it 
yes unfortunately yes no school marks no appllications no nothing just that one big exam 
wow what about after school activities and other accomplishments 
nothing but the exam and the reason if there were applications or other things tna exam there would be huge amounts of bribing and cheating through documents 
wow do u have an issue with bribing in turkey 
hi daniel im from salvador brazil and mariana bacellar told me that you will be in the summer camp in praga 
aha yeah d i am so excited so how long have you been involved with cisv 
yes me too ive been in cisv since 4 years ago i looove cisv what about you 
haha i love ciisv too d i have been in it for 5 years p 
are you familiar in c because im stuck with my assignment 
i done a little bit of c before i can help 
so heres my program the gist of the program is to input a date and then tell which day of the week the date is so the formula should be right and everything but when i run the program and i type in my stuff after the printf prompt it doesnt do anything when i press enter like this just doesnt do anything 
print the variable y put the print line statement on line 25 see if the year is output properly 
so add printfy on line 25 nothing is popping up in the program only shows the original statement enter a date in the form 
printfi y put that on line 25 that should print the variable if it being properly store stored 
oh yea its not printing hm so it wasnt properly stored 
yea its because of your scanning printfi d replace the line 25 with this can u send me the text file of the code 
yea it does i hate this prof 
haha yea the prof is being annoying with this question on purpose i think so what you have to do is take the input from the user as a string and then break the string up into 3 smaller strings the day month and year then parse those strings into int and then continue from there the rest of your code looks right tho 
ah okay thanks a lot for the tip and for helping me at 124 am lol 
yea no problem man yo i think there is a mistake in the formula part of your code too 
hm where 
i dont know but i tried some test values and i am not getting the right result 
oh it doesnt work for january and february i still need to do adjustments for that 
oh okay 
but it should work from march december 
here is another way to take the input in and break it down its cleaner i put those printlines of day month and year in for testing purposes 
ooh wow thanks do you mind sending me a version thats not going horizontally tho lol 
oh is the file all on one line 
ya 
try this one 
hm same thing i can read it in one line tho its no problem 
lol wait never mind that solution wont work all the time forgot what i said lol 
this is a tough assignment haha this prof is notorious for giving tough assignments just doing 14th of the assignment is tough enuf 
lol shitty who is the prof 
his name is nathan friedman he probably only teaches our course because hes taught it for 10 years 
haha yea well good luck on the assignment 
thanks okay i figured out a way to solve my initial problem 
oh cool did it take long to figure it out 
an hour lol neat right 
oh nice thats a good solution 
hey daniel still working on my assignment but was wondering if u have any ideas if for example today is january 4th and my program assigns it a number from 06 and for this random date it assigns it as 2 which means tuesday how do i write a program that will tell me the next time its tuesday 
what do u mean the next time it is tuesday 
never mind its a really tough assignment and i dont want to give you headaches as well lol if ure done with ed board u can come up to the 2nd floor where we might be playing league haha 
its thirsday lol no edboard 2nite 
i mean tomorrow 
oh haha that makes more sense yea depending on how much work i get done tonight ill come 
yea get on it haha u need to show off you are tris skills whats the prompt to test the ping at ssmu haha 
ping 21652241254 lol 
87 its not too bad 
thats definitely playable i dont think i am gonna make it tonight i am working on my feature which is due saturday and i havent started it yet 
haha thats alright good luck oon your feature 
haha thanks i think i will need it are you writing any features this year 
probably not this semester i just have too many writing projects on my deck right now but definitely next 
do you know what you would do it on 
i actually want to do something on the ethics of ai i originally thought about self driving cars but now with all the talk on fake news 
both of those would be really cool 
is there a decision yet on who would become the next boss 
for eic 
yea 
nothing official yet but nick is the only person who applied so i think it will be nick 
lol i think so too ure gonna stay 
ye i plan on it are u thinking of coming back 
na not as an editor 
thats fair 
although u never know ive been thinking of returning as features editor in my last year 
yea features editor seems like the most fun editor spot 
ill do it when i feel like i can impart knowledge to the future generation haha do u guys know whos running for managing ed yet 
no i dont think the applications are out yet 
oh okay lol im starting to think that if arts students took comp 208 half would drop out im serious 
haha i feel that way w all of my cs courses lol 
yea maybe this is just my first one but holy shit the assignments are so tough i think u sort of expect this in engineering but when everyone i know is panicking 
haha when u solve a problem the resulting euphoria is all worth it in the end 
yea but i feel like this course will either scar you for life or make you love programming 
ahhhahahahah ye true 
has there been an official announcement of eic yet can i send a congratulatory message to nick my former boss haha 
yup it is nick 
haha ill probably work in the board just to annoy nick 
hahahajajaj

oh cool why did u transfer 
because i didnt like business at ryerson and i found myself that im better at envio and york is known for envio so thats why 
yea york has a higher ranking so it sounds like an upgrade 
i know it is a higher school so i havd to use a transcript from online school its hard to study when you have adsd like me 
ye i can imagine did u go back to fredericton this summer 
no i would tried to meet you if i visited there 
true so does your family live in toronto now

nice mine is 506 261 0224 
ive been doing a some research about fascism and i found that 9000 nazis fled to south africa and also responsible for apartheid 
really i know that a lot of nazis went to argentina where did u read that 
article about fascism and aparteid 
thats fucked up are you reading this for class 
yup hey are you visiting toronto this summer 
no man im working in fredericton this summer 
it is just a meme for liberals wonder if you understand this 
haha i dont get it 
hey 
how was the exam 
yes son it is me whats up gangster 
haha living life how the fuck are you and i hope you voted for coon in there election 
im not 18 yet that answers both of your questions i guess the dcoon thing wasnt a question whatever 
haha lame why are u back on facebook 
im not i made this when i was drunk and dont intend to use it dont let that keep you from sending me shit mind you and you can always email me faerieprincess69gmailcom 
do u check that at all 
everyday or almost everyday ive let a bunch of people know thats how to contact me though literally no one has so maybe i should give up on that 
haha people love facebook man 
its fucking awful fuck people for enjoying it no disrespect of course 
haha fuck most people man i wanna hang out with the boys 2night 
yeah rob was telling me how he hates a lot of the people in his program we could all have a romantic skype date 
fuck skype im flying home 
for an evening with the boiz thats commitment 
the boy over everything man 
bros before breathing amirite 
haha so how are things in the 506 
its october and i still dont have a job my brightest prospect recently was an interview from the dollarama but i just got an email telling me that i didnt get the job the election was hilarious im happy david coon got elected 
haha how did the interview go 
really really well fuck this job market 
yeah really tho i am worried about getting a job when i get back 
like during the summer 
yeah 
yeah a lot of kids will be coming back from university looking for work like every year circle of life man 
haha yeah it will be hard riddle me this have u considered dealing 
considered but i dont have enough friends plus you know im a shit head and would probably get caught 
ahahahahahaha you make friends by selling 
true but i wouldnt be looking for friends id be looking for buyers and since id only really be allowed to sell to friends unless id want to get serious which i wouldnt i would need to get more friends first which as i said if i was dealing i would not be interested in finding new friends 
haha have u been smokin mad trees recently 
like today no only a few tokes between the weekend before last and last weekend yes definitely 
haha what did u do week long sesh 
not exactly i dont have the money but something close to that 
that chronic what do you generally do most days 
look for workhand out resumes or nothing basically only those two things 
define nothing browsing webs 
get high and watch adventure time something of that nature i read too 
sounds like you are living the life aside from the resume shit 
well yeah kind of living the life feels like shit though which goes to show that in fact life is shit no matter what youre doing and we just have to carry on in that fashion 
thats the spirit 
im not having children ever fuck that 
haha why do you say that 
well aside from economic and ecological reasons life is pretty fucked up and its therefore more fucked up to create life for what can only ultimately be either selfindulgence or a mindless instinct devoid of anything that is true about the self that is me ya know 
man you ever think that you are over thinking the whole life thing 
all the time thats what philosophy is give me the details on this girl 
search valerie woof wood she is asian 
shes catholic 
haha did u find her 
ye 
she was in rome for awhile and thought it was funny shes agnostic 
do you believe in love at first site or should i just walk by again daniel 
ahahahahhahahahahhahahahahshahahhahahahahhahhahaa what woulf u give her out of 10 
i dont like the 10 system shes hot but im not a big fan of her face 
wait why dont u like the 10 system 
twofold its not descriptive and trying to quantify attractiveness in that manner is just kind of icky ya know 
haha its a strong baseline would u rank her above rachel or joli 
no i think rachel is more attractive joli im not so sure about but i think joli is pretty damn funny so i consider her more attractive i dont know its difficult to compare women i know to a woman i dont 
very true i want to drop the situation but dont know how 
how serious are you two just fucking do you have classes together 
not a class pure sec sex 
pfft dont worry about it then be an adult about it tell her what you want how you feel and hope she responds by also being an adult but at the end of the day only you can stop fucking her so regardless of how she responds just stop fucking her although i remind you my relationship advice is not to be trusted 
i think you are right 
rob appears to be what the french would call a limp bizkut 
no kitten hes a real dead beat dad 
hed beat a dead dad off thats for darn certain hes a good guy though sure hes studying

minimally the admin is fucking nuts and i refuse to be on their side even a little thomas especially fuck 
haha he is making making such a fucking fool of him self 
totally god i hate school admin ive never met an administrator i looked liked much like police

i thinks a matter of the job attracting those people 
ye 
insecure megalomaniacs 
haha have u gone up to fhs recently sit in on a class 
not yet i popped in for 5 minutes to say hi to sally but that was a while ago 
what was she saying 
we didnt say much classes were starting when i was there and i didnt want to waste her class time 
is it true she is teaching a ninth grade class 
yes as i understand it saw it on her door 
hm i wonder how she likes that 
i asked her end of last year and she seemed fine with it i mean shed rather be teaching 11s12s but likes the opportunity to get kids into history shit unlike other gr 9 teachers 
yeah true 
but now that shes teaching a class i dont know how she feels 
shit u know who is runnin model un 
hamish right 
reallly hahhaahha 
i think who else i wouldnt really trust the others vinson and the guy i never remember theyre cool 
brandon 
yeah but everyone else is cringey 
haha man vincent is cringey 2 me 
or unqualified 
yeah 
vinson is good at model un though just socially weird yooooooooo 
hey srry i was studying 
i gotcha whats up still in the thick of it 
yeah sadly 2 more to go 
best of luck dog yo are you back in freddy beach now 
yeah got in this afternoon 
swag did your last exams go well 
not really i was just like fuck it its over 
nice well at least its behind you youre certainly welcome to drop by sans rob ayyy 
ayyyyy 
what up when you want to come over 
im busy till christmas how about the 26th 
sounds dope youre welcome to come on christmas even once youre done the festivities 
we go late into the night on the eve what time should i swing by on the 26th 
evening im assuming you plan to stay the night 
ye ye ye i brought back a little ganja if i wanna blazze 
im down i have a bottle of whiskey 
shooottzzzz bro lyffe 
youre also allowed to smoke in the kitchen no standing outside and freezing your ass off 
oh cool 
ye m8 
it must feel wierd smoking indoors 
its pretty normal once you do it 
whoops but yeah also its sick because u live close to sobeyss mad snax 
aw yes also the superstore and the ultramar 
a true party for 2 also whats the deal with rob amirite 
look if he doesnt want to hang then frankly im not that interested if hes really swimming in that much pussy that he cant make time for us then theres no good i can do for him and i wish him the best 
its just weird haha 
totally 
he didnt really give a reason did he 
no 
haha so you are just assuming is knee deep in pussy 
ye he did say something something about bitches wanting to see him so thats my first clue but yeah either thats true or he just doesnt want to hang 
haha so strange 
or theres something else thats up thats secret i dunno but honestly he cant even spare an evening come on robs a handsome dude but its probably just raiyan and the sally crew that want to see him sally crew rather 
i suspect that raiyan has something to do with this seeing as he hates me and u 
i dunno i really dont get her and rob as a couple 
nor do i 
let alone as a couple serious enough to limit each others friend groups especially after all this time 
haha i can see rob being whipped by riayan tho 
its weird yeah totally but at the same time i dont understand why hed be into that kind of restraint like honestly the guy has options so i doubt its raiyans decision alone everything on for tomorrow 
you know it 
swiggity holla at me before you come over 
yo 
ayyy 
do u know jakob w 
ye

hey daniel when do you want the edited version by hey the last article is incorrect o thats the paragraph to the one befoe can it be changed im so sorry 
oh that fine ill change it do you have the text for the gerr resignation 
yes 
okay cool can u send it to me 
on march 9 ssmu president ben ger resigned from his position citing personal reasons at a legislative council meeting later that day it was revealed that ger had been the subject of allegations of gendered violence the remaining ssmu executives acknowledged that gers own history of gendered violence had made him improperly equipped to handle the allegations against aird as with arid gers responsibilities were divided up among the remaining executives and ssmu vice president student life elaine patterson was made acting president theres no link in the paragraph 
okay its fixed thanks for the heads up 
yes no problem it was a fault on my part that paragraph has to be deleted actually its not from the one before i verified 
so there should only be one paragraph for the laval divest thing 
yes 
okay cool its all fixed now 
thanks again sorry for the negligence 
aha dont worry about it

httpsappearintribune hey here is the video chat room we can use 
hey daniel how can i open that httpwwwmcgilltribunecomwploginphp the thing is ive figured out what needs to be done but i just have ftp and to make such design changes i need to have admin rights hey so noah gave me admin rights but now i realize that the theme were currently using is foxy tribune which doesnt have an ftp do you know how i can get that i need that in order to make changes to the theme templates 
hm im not sure 
oh

i cant or at least i think i cant ill look into it though 
kk let me know if it doesnt work 
hey bro so if i make changes on the development server where can i see those changes i made a change on the main server removed the carousel since that was a change that seemed pretty easy the site on the development server looks completely different bro 
yea the css hasnt been ported to the development server in awhile if you want u can copy the code for the main server on to the development server 
alright will do that 
kk let me know if you have any problems

haha are u gonna go 
if its a big party hey who did you use as a broker when you invested n shiz 
yeah when u trade in large volumes you are trades get cheaper so i am trading under my dad so my transactions are really cheap but usually a broker is like 60 a trade 
by cheap under your dad do you mean your dad is paying so its cheap for you who does your brokerage ill most likely do discount broking under my bank 
its cheap because my dad trades in high volumes so he gets cheaper trades so i trade as him to get the cheap rates he does i use td 
yup i was going td 2 so its not the volume of one trade but of total trades ya in terms of price 
yeah if u trade 2 shares or 30000 shares its the same price 
did you learn from pops or anywhere specific trying to learn as much as possible 
a book called one up on wall street and just wikipedia shit

bruce wayne is the batman oh god dude just not the night i expected at all 
go on go on 
man so in my mind it was gonna be me and her watching a movie and talking on the couch but then some of her friend came over and they brought more until there was 10 of us then they were like lets go get an icecap from tims so 5 of us get into one car and the other 5 get into another i get into the car next to her in the back then they just fucking take off going like 120 in 50 zones and swerving into the other lane and oncoming traffic and i was scared shitless i guess we were racing the other car and then she jumped a curb to avoid a red light and then we went to the highway and drove at insane speeds again in the dark heading towards some ski hill way outta the way then they went to some old abandoned house which was actually cool but that lasted like 5 minutes then they stopped in at a party for another 5 10 minutes then we left and they took me to butterfly hill which is just a huge hill that if you go really fast on the car goes off the ground and the whole time there were screaming and having a good time and i was like in the back quiet with nothing to say i do not think this girl is the one for me this lasted from like 9 to 1130 
christ did u know any of the others 
yea i knew all of them but still man i was like this is how people fie die 
yeah thats fucking crazy were u friends with any of the others 
yes they were all girls 
even the driver 
shes in my bio class but i dont really know her all that well only one other person in the car was on my side like she kept asking the girl to slow down httpwwwfacebookcomhannahtilley58 
man thats fuckedup who was it is that like a normal thing to do there 
apparently 
christ thats stupid was the driver drunk 
no nobody was drinking 
thats almost worse 
yea man i really didnt like that 
how did u manage to leave 
when they went back home i was there for the whole ride 
shit i just expected u to fuck the girl or something when u said not the night i expected 
i wish man it sucked haha and im pretty sure the girl was kinda put off by the fact that i wasnt being rowdy or anything 
haha good 
but fuck man if all the cute girls up here are like this im screwed 
was rayleen there 
no ill show you who was in the car with me 
kk kk 
httpwwwfacebookcomamyshort731 httpwwwfacebookcomallycleal httpwwwfacebookcomhannahtilley58 i cant remember the drivers name but she wasnt good looking haha 
l0l what are u going to do if it happens again 
i dont know man im in a tight spot i mean i cant afford to burn any friends ive made so far ill probably just be like nope and go home when they go driving actually haha 
make up an excuse or some shit 
my aunt was telling me about how one time she tried to sneak out to a party with here friends by climbing out a window and my grand dad was standing there and he was like you just crawl right back where you came from 
and 
and that night her friends crashed and 2 of them died 
shit 
ye i hate driving as it is so that was like horrifying haha 
you should have called the cop on yourself 
haha could you imagine 
haha that would have been funny 
well the whole time my mom thought i was like 10 houses down 
did u tell it parents 
no god no id never be able to go out again 
hahsaaha 
i just texted her and said i was gonna be out late and to leave the door unlocked i ended up getting home by about 1130 thoughm because the driver had a curfew im glad shes responsible 
hagaha did u know kids did this there 
no idea 
that must have been a surprise 
like if they were just rowdy at partys i could handle that because atleast i could get drunk but sober in a car going 120 in a neighbour hood i cant do it haha

shit how could i forget such a juicy beaver 
haha anyways i was just looking at boards online im gonna try and hit the hay again bye tomorrow dude 
see ya and may gods grace be upon you in these trying times 
httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvc5p26wwal6a never mind im probably watching buried then going to bed 
whays buried 
an hour and a half film staring ryan renolds the entire thing is just him in a box buried somewhere its supposed to be really good haha i know it sounds dumb httpwwwimdbcomtitlett1462758 
haha just blaze and you will fall asleep 
nope im done i wasnt joking haha i put all my stuff away my backpack is emptied im done for at least a month to get a feel of how tough my semester will be 
ballsy 
if i think i can blaze and do well then i will but if i cant then im done for the year until next summer 
what about weekends 
and like some scattered parties nope 
wow do you think you will be able to stick to that 
its going to be really fucking hard haha but i can probably do it i may just let myself smoke every second weekend or something if its that hard to stop 
i dont blaze nearly as much as you but for me stopping is no problem i mean if it isnt addictive it shouldnt be too bad 
oh its not like that its not like man i just neeeeeed to smoke right now its more like man i know i could totally smoke right now and it just wouldnt matter 
yea thats the thing i mean if u smoke on a friday night then it wont effect your monday 
i think ill make a rule where i can only smoke once everything else is out of the way and only during weekends that seems pretty appropriate 
yea makes sense i guess this diet will be a good money saver 2 
haha yea i was talking about that with joli today actually im going to have way more cash ill be too busy with school to go shopping really and since im cutting back on the ganja that saves me like so much money i think i probably spend like 200 a month on pot and thats probably low balling it 
haha fuck man start buying in bulk by the way just loved them joints last night but where did u get the weed for the pipe 
sydney he had like 4gs 
haha oh fuck thanks syd i just remember you handing me the pipe and walking away

no amanda buala 
rebecca was there too dude and amanda 
i dont remember that at alll 
i remember perfectly rebecca asked me if id let her have a hit of the pipe next time i smoked then amanda came and wanted some and i knew i wouldnt have enough for everybody so i packed them their own bowl and went outside to the smoke spot where you were thats when i gave you guys the pipe and said enjoy then i left 
10 seconds later i took a hit then walled away 
haha really alex dean brought me my pipe and was like hey man i saw this on the deck its yours right i remember from last time whatagreatguy 
haha i gave it to amanda then walked away haha i wonder what she did dude just smoke a j worked im tired

thats my main problem i only have 1 class with her math and she sits in a spot which makes starting a conversation with her nearly impossible haha 
i sit nearish 2 her in poli sci ill talk u up 
i heard he just has a monster of a cock 
ill pass her a note that says that and then be like oh fuck that wasnt 4 u 
haha im trying a different appraoch i started a conversation with rachel mcadam one of annas friends saying the old oh i havent talked to you in forever spiel after about 30 minutes i casually brought up the subject of crushes and stuff like that she asked the same question back and i said theres this girl i dont know if youd know her anna standing well something along the lines of that anyways news will inevitably be passed on to anna rachel being my main source of info 
what she say 
hoping to get the she thinks youre cute message is this works out not tonight obvs but some time in the future its weird actually she said i smoked pot with johnny hopkins it was me and johnny hopkins and we blazed that shit all day just kidding she hasnt responded 
haha 
she did however say jaclyn is free haha 
fick her 
haha i basically said that 
wait so she just disregarded that message 
no no this was before the fact we were talking about crushes i told her i kinda had one and she said oh i dont know if your still into jaclyn retalick or not anymore but shes single now 
wait so u havent brought up anna yet 
just did 
fingaz crossed 
haha lets see how she goes still hasnt seen the message yet 
dun dun dun 
oh 2 things 
ye 
1 know whos taken a liking to me like inviting me to his house and stuff 
who 
luke benoit haha 
hahahahahaahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahah what the fuck what class u got with him 
environmental studies plus i see him at most parties i go to he invited me over this friday to smoke from his new hooka haha i told him im on that break though 
haha thats funnky do you like the guy 
hes not a bad guy i guess i mean i wouldnt hang with him every day or anything but once in a while sure man shes offline shed better see this message tonight 
haha why did she go offline 
shes pretty spotty with convos takes like 10 minutes for a reply most times 
what the fuck haha 
been 13 minutes so far 
10 52 not looking so good 
could be getting ready for bed she seems like the type to go to bed at this time 
haha yea she really does thats a draw back of anna her friends 
yea i noticed haha but oh well gradyear 
if u can get it do it have u alked to her yet 
anna 
yea 
i wish i have literally no chances to 
haha is super cool actually 
she is how so gimme the details 
yea she has good taste and a good sense of humor 
taste in music and what not im diggin it man haha 
yea music and like tv and she is smart and doesnt seem to have any negative qualities other than she is kinda quiet which is more a negative for u 
haha thats true im a talker but i can usually coax a conversation out of most people 
step one grab throat 
step 2 reveal my concealed bowie rachel is killing me here 
maybe it can wait a day 
def can im just impatient haha shell def see it in the am though 
man do u think this is the best method 
ah its up there knowing how girls like these talk it could very well work out 
but for her man u have never talked to her and then she hears that you like her that may weird her out 
nope i specifically mentioned i havent talked to her i never even said i have a crush just i thought she was very pretty i got all the bases covered my man haha 
haha but how can it move forward man she know u think she is hot what next 
im hoping to get rachel to be kind of an informant without her actually knowing it first she tells anna i said i thought she was cute not because i told her too but because i just casually mentioned it then ill start another conversation with her and see if she brings up anything like anna said she thought you were cute too but you didnt hear it from me making rachel think shes pulling all the strings when really im the puppet master 
haha but how are u going to talk 2 her 
if rachel says anything about anna being mildly interested at all ill bring up the idea of a lunch like the 3 of us or something ill drive talk with her that could lead to me messaging her on facebook to me getting her number to then going to lunch with just her and so on and so forth also just by talking with her once ill then be able to talk to her any math class then its not weird or out of the blue 
i am really curious to see how this goes 
same actually its probably my most elaborate plan yet 
haha yea 
anyways if it doesnt work out theres always jaclyn 
ahahaahha oh god if u went back to her 
i wouldnt id defintely hook up with her though for the shits shits n gigs man shits n gigs nobody could blame me 
haha true httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid294397203942624sett100001520615455type3theater word nugga

haha what how do u hit it 
you take like sips like you hold the batter for a long time and take sips ever like 2 3 seconds to cool the chamber but the vaporization occurs at higher temperatures the longer it lasts so it vapes the weed way more battery its a super noticeable amount better haha 
sweet are u hitting it now 
yep long day at the offive office oh by the way i found another must play indie game this one is 1 million times better than that democracy one 
what is

there was like 30 minutes until she had to go and i started kinda moving my hand into position and she said she that she didnt really want to because she had to leave so soon also we were both tired as fuck which kinda threw it off on the drive back home after i dropped her off i felt like i could have fallen asleep behind the wheel also what makes you say 95 
okay she takes her bag to the bathroom why else would she then she makes you stay over the panties two big signs 
mahaaan what if shes still on it 
well that was 6 days ago so its with in range 
how long does these things go im unfamiliar

oooooh i read it like its a big time eater you know i was like what 
ahahahahaahhahah 
got to a 6 12 
haha on the decline 
yes sir going to bed night dude 
night 
dan dan dna dan dan dan dan so big man 
ye 
told my mom i vape came 100 clean 
what why 
told her literally everything 
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
we had a huge heart to heart and i just felt the need to tell her shes decently cool about it i can do it at home she wont tell my dad 
fuck man thats crazt 
shes going to watch a movie with me while i vape to see how it effects me 
ahahahhahahahahaha man thats crazyyyyyy 
i knowwwww ah so much stress off my shoulders she doesnt support it though 
haha does jason no 
if she could shed get me to stop no also she said if jason found out shed kill me so he wont be smoking with me anymore 
fuck man thats so good that went so well 
we talked for an hour she said she needs to do more research on it because she thinks its like a terrible drug that makes you lose control of yourself 
haha lose control 
so i used my vast knowledge of the subject to slightly alter her perspective she said something like the chemicals take over your brain or something like that she also said she never wants me to drive high 
that makes sense i guess 
i told her i have though 
what she say 
didnt approve but she understands that my motor skills are all there when im high i told her the only thing im worried about is if i make a mistake that i would have made sober anyways and then get pulled over for it that they might know i was high but i made sure she knew its not the weed that would cause me to make the mistake yknow 
yea yea and she isnt telling hal 
nope this is between me and her 
nice so u getting the vape back and does she know jason blazes 
no if she knew that shed probably tell ha hal im getting jason off of it too risky now hell have to wait until hes older to try this move for himself haha right away she was like so thaaaats why you like those incense so much 
haha she must have half knew lol 
nope she had no clue i asked her she said she was wondering about the visine but that thought never crossed her mind because remember she found my visine one day 
fuck dude stealthy do u think she would blaze 
no i asked her she laughed and said she never would because if hal found out hed divorce her she just came downstairs to make sure there was no evidence that i had ever smoked pot on facebook she said i need to cover my tracks haha sim is so fucking cool 
is there anyand fuck man hal dont mess around i know man jelly

none were really set in place as of yet all she said is only at home to which i said i do it out a lot too so she said no driving which is fair and i may start abiding by those rules 
yea so u arent gonna blaze out and around town 
man think there will be school tomorrow no no i will she just said no driving basically i conviced her to let me do it outside the house 
oh makes sense fuck so will u be able to smoke on you are back deck u think 
no i didnt tell her i smoke i said i always vape because its health healthy 
oh i see 
i will tell her though just easing into it

just had another talk with mama mac 
what did she say 
so i have a doctors appointment coming up and they have to do a blood test she said she doesnt want me to do it until after the blood test 11 days 
haha why 
just for her own peace of mind she said that during those 11 days she will research the topic and if i can promise her that i can go 11 days without doing it because i told her how there is no dependancy on it that shell try it 
haha what the fuck 
right then after she tries it shell make up her mind how insane is that 11 days until i sesh with simona 
make up her mind on what 
if shell allow me to continue but since its her first time shell barely feel it also well vape so it will be such a light high my hope is that shell think wow he really is 100 normal when high and let me continue 
haha just make her take like 3 hits and say its a lot 
yea that too were gonna have 1 trench between the both of us 
has she ever drank 
barely glasses of wine at special events kinda thing 
because if she has never done something that changes how she feelsacts she may get freaked oh by the way have u smoke any of the shit we got yesterday

haha we can work on it tuesday

u up 
she says that anna is just super stressed right now and has a lot going on shes just acting like that to cope apparently and i shouldnt take it personally dude fuck i said i was worried she was getting tired of me and she said i honestly dont know if thats the case or not i guess youll have to wait and see i then said i hope shes not tired of me and she said me either but you never know look maybe you should talk to anna about this i dont want to say anything i shouldnt 
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fuck man 
man 
u still talking to her 
i said im going to talk about it soon i dont want this to linger and she said im sure she doesnt either 
man 
dude if this is a breakup i dont know if ill be able to handle it haha 
man sabrina is sending charged messages 
i dont know man it seems like she knows something that i dont and its not a good something kk i told her i was gonna talk to her as soon as possible i said thats what ill probably do then hopefully theres nothing to talk about p she said haha heres hoping fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck what am i going to do i mean im going to ask to talk to her alone right after math tomorrow but what if she just ends it 
man do you think she will 
i dont know dude honestly it doesnt look very good 
i dont think she will tomorrow 
but i mean if she wants to tomorrow would be the time to do it 
well i guess give her the chance to do it 
maybe i will need those meds haha i just need to go lay down man ive never felt so worried in my life 
good luck man take it easy 
fuckkkk man i wish i could just fast forward to the talk i cant take this waiting every second is absolute torture 
just have a bowl and take it easy for the night 
i cant even have a bowl man i wont enjoy it im just going to go to sleep ill maybe bye tomorrow dude 
bye man 
man 
what 
was talking to anna about her drawings 
and what 
and i was like really though youre incredibly talented at drawing and painting too that eye you painted was so good i had to save it to my phone i wish i had some kind of artistic ability she responds back with as long as its not your wallpaper or anything is that cold or am i looking too into it because im worried 
be like why not 
haha i can understand how thatd be a little weird but like just saving it is totally acceptable 
haha maybe reading in too much 
i hope so its just because she kinda singled out the saving the photo part you know its almost like saying dont get too attached 
i no man not good 
im kind of at the point where ive just accepted that its gonna be a breakup it cant be coincidental sabrinas messages annas texts that thing at starbucks shes ending it dude 
u sure 
not 100 but like i have a terrible feeling about all this 
man it could just be nothing 
i know i was just thinking i hope it is 
yea me too 
all i can do is wait i guess haha fuck man school i dont want to deal with this shit hanging out with anna tomorrow theres something she wants to talk to me about 
no fucking way man how u feeling 
tired haha this is going to suck to have to go through im glad im getting it out of the way right off the bat though i might go to a party tomorrow night get some tail bro 
man you think this is the end 
its looking that way 
do you think youll beat her to the punch 
as in break up with her first 
yea 
no i dont care who ends it im gonna let her say what she wants to say then im going to say what i want to say and see what happens 
yea man how did she bring that up 
i asked if she wanted to hang out tomorrow and she was like yea i have something ive been meaning to talk to you about 
oh man so u think thats the kiss of death 
could very well be man 
how did u feel when she said that 
i was with chris at his house seshing and it put a downer on my mood at the same time though im kinda like thank god thats over haha 
yea man i know what you mean it probably a little bitter sweet for you whos party u going to 
kylies i think 
party on man what if tomorrow night is the night u lose you are virginty im drunk by the way 
where u drunk at and haha thatd be wild 
im just at richards house hanging out have u talked to sabrina at all 
not since yesterday but fuck her haha 
yeah really dude fuck her she was just mean to youman what ever happens tomorrow just remember that no matter how bad it feels that she is in the wrong and that you are the nice guy she can what ever but you will still be the though full one you need to know that she may be pretty and she may be smart but you are still better man your gonna get a girl soon that apretaites you not full nice 
haha thanks dude straight to the heart 
yea man its the truth on an other note when is hal leaving 
early january i think but im not sure i havent heard word of it since the day i was first told 
so do you think it will still happen 
i think so but im not certain 
why dont you ask 
never really crossed my mind haha 
i see i see well unlimited seshs when he leaves man its too bad that u and you are dad dont get along but it seems like he brought it on him self 
its starting to get better actually slowly but surely 
yea how so 
talking more n shit like that 
yea that makes sense like did he act differently after u got diagnosed with depression 
slightly 
really lm do u think he believed it 
no 
do u believe it 
he thinks the doc was fucked too 
hahhs the doc did meth pre apoitment probabily 
almost 100 sure haha anyways im going to bed night dude 
night man good luck tomorrow keep me updated 
you think youd wanna go to kylies tonight 
no i have family plans when are you hanging with anna 
7 then going to the party directly afterwards haha 
haha why so late 
her choice i think she knows this wont be long the time alone is a bad sign 
yea where are you meeting her 
probably picking her up i always do i dont know where ill take her though like honestly id rather go over break up then leave right away haha 
haha yea makes sense man do u really think this is the end 
i dont know what else it could be haha 
yeah i guess how are you feeling about the whole thing 
i dont care that much anymore i just dont want to have to go through all these formalities 
yea would you rather it be over text 
no i guess not im glad its in person but its still gonna suck 
yea man do you think youll still be upfor the party after it all 
last night i was thinking about this whole thing and playing songs on itunes and then this one song came on that perfectly summed up my feelings about this relationshio relationship i think itll make me wanna party more youve probably already heard this before but listen to it again with my situation in mind its perfect httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvffgsf3pqad8 what you up to today down to go to the mall i need to finish up my christmas shopping

haahhaha httpwwwbiographycomimportedimagesbiographyimagesprofileswchristopherwalken95218541402jpg 
i was hoping youd pick up haha i found out what was wrong with loadout that one time we played the game supports xbox controllers and mine was plugged in and lying on the floor with the analogue stick being pushed ever so slightly forward

httpiimgurcom3qmfejpg 
its jason on his pc hes working until 7 but i like the diagram im gonna try that tonight josh 
haha how was work 
easy 3 hour shift haha felt like an hour 
so is the party still happening this weekend did u get work covered 
work is not covered and the party isnt happening haha 
shitty its it because of work 
mostly also jasons having friends over and thats not a big deal but its something more to worry about plus oreo 
yes anything big happen school 2 day 
nothin outta the ordinary i was talking with emily andrews in marketing and i invited her to my party but now im not having it haha man emily is pretty sweet its just that one thing thats keeping me from making any kinda move 
the stash 
ye haha and i feel terrible saying that 
haha ask her to shave it tomorrow 
lol there is literally no way to bring that up in any situation 
aahhahahado an add for gillette for marketing 
then be like i already shaved mine well have to use yours 
haha can you look past it 
i was just thinking about that myself ill have to see haha im not going to invest myself too much into it though although she is coming over friday 
for a project also no school that day prob give her a rose that day and say happy valentines day 
haha could you imagine man that vape thing went horrible wrong 
haha what happened 
so i attempted the setup but with a water bottle in place of the coke but since the vape has to be held horizontally to work i couldnt hold it like it was demonstrated in the photo so instead i kind of had to hold the bottle at like a 44 degree angle anyway i have an empty cup to drain the water into but instead of actually poking a hole before hand as im not realizing i should have done i just took my little pocket knife and stabed a hole into it but it was more of a slit so the water started pouring out everywhere and i squeezed the bottle when i realized it was leaking which forced air out of the bottle and back up the stem of the mflb that caused a huge ploom of smoke and vapor to escape around the seals of the mflbs top and made my room instantly really dank 
ahhahahhaahahahhahahhahagaggaga lol 
i feel like i explained that story extremely well haha 
i could taste that one on point i saw mamma mac at value village 2 night by the way 
haha did you talk 
just a hi bye lol

john cenaaaaaaa found your cardigan under my bed haha 
its rachels i aint no gay still want me to film tomorrow 
yes sirr man last night i woke up and went upstairs in my boxers to get a drink of milk i looked around and was like where did all this mess come from then i remembered everything that happened and that you and rachel were right down the hall haha 
ahahhahaah so cass last night were u surprised 
no i wasnt surprised im the fucking man haha to be honest i was kinda expecting something to happen and im glad it did 
did you are parents suspect anything when they came home 
well my mom knew before hand hal didnt suspect anything tho 
nice man what did u think of pauls cockblock last night 
i think that i went down stairs right after and made out with cassidy again haha so i dont care i can barely remember what he said something about fisting 
ahhahs oh i didnt hear that he just made is very apparent that you guys had been making out 
oh then i dont know lol i dont know why chris would bring him 
haha they had been hanging out earlier but for u dislike him 
its not that i dont like him its just he doesnt do anything to make me enjoy him haha 
haha like liam connors 
pretty much haha the thing is chris was originally gonna get drunk and blaze then stay the night but instead he had paul over which meant he couldnt do any of those things 
shit man that would have been sweet if chris stayed shit 
yes i dont get it haha 
maybe he fwlt obligated to hang with paul 
maybe haha i dont know i think it woulda been better if he stayed 
yea i wonder if his parents said he couldnt stay because it was you are place 
i was thinking the same thing i dont know why they dont like me so much like even if they know i smoke i dont think ive ever done anything that would make them thing im a bad guy think so its like 100 that 
yea its a really strange reaction both sets of chris parents seem kinda fucked to me though 
yea i dont really enjoy going to either of his houses because of them i just never feel welcomed haha theres always a vibe of we dont trust you im just glad evan didnt show up with her friends haha 
haha she was at dooleys apparently hahahsh yeah but that would have been really weird 
yea apparently haha that message was just awkward 
haha yea it really was i wonder why she didnt come 
she was more interested in getting super drunk 
ahga how drunk were u last night 
pretty drunk haha i had that pint finished pretty quick 
yea i noticed not many people drank 
which was disappointing haha 
yea so when are we filming tomorrow

its okay really havent been out to many i work weekends now im also going to the gym a lot haha there have been a few good campus parties but other than that its harder to find parties just because in hs there were facebook groups for them haha now you just have to kinda find one yourself and even then you may not know the host

ye haha my cooworker is a gr 12 esa chick so it was different lol 
whats her name 
hannah toner 
whats her deal 
cool girl smokes a lot not interested though haha maybe if i wasnt already kinda with that other girl 
yeah man what the deal with courtney u said the other day that she is the perfect girl 
shes rad but shes also complicated haha a tough nut to crack its hard to explain and honestly i barely understand the situation myself haha i dont know what it is but i think its worth sticking around for 
are u guys doing shit or just hanging out 
shit every now and then but its not like every time we hang out 
strange have u asked her about it 
oh yeah weve talked about it she doesnt wanna really call it anything but she does like me its kinda more because she just moved here 
hm makes sensehow often do u hang out 
2 or 3 times a week probably its very casual haha i dont know what the hell is going on to be honest 
thats a weird situation to be in is it reminiscent of anna at all like that vibe 
not at all thats the thing when we do hang its wicked haha its more of the inbetween thats the weird part if that makes sense lol 
yeah totally does she smoke 
yes but not too too often like maybe once every couple weeks 
hm coool have u done the deed with her yet 
no havent smoked yet shes very against smoking and driving so its hard to find a good time 
haha i meant had sex haha or is it just like make out and shit 
make out and shit the universe does not want me to get laid 
haha you always pick the good girls 
im a good guy haha 
haha its the one fatal flaw in you are game 
my hubris 
are tanya and liam still dating 
yup 
wowo thats a long time 
pretty much a year

haha back on friday morrn 
well try and get all the dudes together i can tell you the story of how i lost my v card 
hey 
hey 
who u lose it to 
random girl at chris university haha we drove down to visit him one weekend liam and i 
shit hahhahaha nice i assumed it would be with that courtney girl 
no man were done but guess who i had over to my place last night and it also is starting to look like this person and i could potentially have a relationship in the not to distant future too 
who 
jaclyn 
mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn 
righttt 
haha any shit go down last night 
well i wanted to play it cool considering our history so i didnt make any real moves then after i dropped her off at her house i got a text pretty much saying you should have kissed me and were planning on hanging out again pretty soon so lets see where this goes 
shit man old flame rekindled how did the first hang out come about 
she messaged me out of the blue one night haha didnt expect it at all 
thats really weird what ended up happening with u and courtney 
friend zoned 
shitty did u guys stay friends on did it fizzle out 
shes really sticking to her guns and we hang out pretty much every week but im trying to slowly put an end to that haha 
haha i hear that it must be kinda awkward now lol 
down for a tag team bro 
thought youd never ask me u and hendricks 
no not really but shes like too friendly now when we watch movies she lays her head on my shoulders and i dont know it just feels weird i dont think she thinks its weird but for me when she does shit like that its just a reminder saying hey youre friend zoned 
wait u friend zoned her 
no no she friend zoned me but she still does stuff like that which is confusing as fuck lol 
its like she is teasing you thats a crazy girl move 
yeah but shes going back to ontario in a couple days and shell be there for a while so hopefully thatll be enough time for me to slowly start limiting contact 
haha did u have classes with her 
no shes in  i met her the first day of orientation 
oh  shit wait why are all the  girls on tinder

the hobbit lol 
haha so can you see this amounting to something long term 
i hope so yeah haha we both seemed really excited by it just the fact that this was all happening again but this time im here for good 
yeah man after all these years looks like you are going to end up with her afterall 
how funny is that she also made me these dope game of thrones snowflakes 
those are so fucking sick 
right 
she def seems like a better girlfriend than annaaa 
oh man so much better she also loves anime which is a huge plus haha she doesnt like my smoking habits very much but she said she wasnt going to ask me to stop just that i be smart with it this all just seems too good im waiting for something to happen 
haha yeah it does almost seem to good to be true maybe she did a lot of thinking in first semester about her life and decided to try again 
apparently she thought about me a lot over the years i thought about her quite a bit too but ah i dont know i hope this works out you going to the cottage tomorrow

thanks dude your big day is right around the corner too 
haha yeah i have u bought liquor legally yet 
i bought liquor right after my morning class haha that was for chris mcginn then i later bought more rum for myself and jaclyn oh dudeeee im dating jaclyn now bf girlfriend the whole shebang she stayed at my house last night and we shared a pint lol 
fuck man thats sick after all these years things are looking up for old josh haha when did it become bf girlfriend 
2 weeks ago somewhere around there 
nice how does she feel about u and the devils lettuce 
she just doesnt want me driving high which is understandable 
haha thanks dog 
do anything wild buy a loto ticket 
haha age for lotto here is 18 murder is legal at 19 here tho so i killed josh liu 
mercy killing haha fuck i forgot you could already drink 
yeah but it will be good for when im home 
hal is not a fan of me drinking not one bit he said he was disappointed in me when i brought a pint of rum home 
haha fuck man does he not drink at all 
wine at weddings thats it 
haha so weird how does sim feel bout it 
shes been cool with it for a long time lol 
lol oh yeah why does hal care 
old school i guess haha i mean i told him im gonna be drinking so its not having too much of an impact on me dude you up 
yes 
man i need someone to talk to right now i am in a weird spot 
whats up 
okay i was talking with jaclyn today and things have been going really well but she brought up something very offputting she wants me to get an sti test 
ahahahahahhahahahahahahha man 
like how the fuck do i respond to that i told her i wouldnt and now shes super upset 
that is such a strange request 
right she says she doesnt know the history of the girls ive been with and she wont feel comfortable until i get one 
with you are luck you will take the test and find out u have aids but thats unreal like who have u been with that is dirty like sarah andrew also like u would know if u had an sti 
yeah i dipped the head of my condom wrapped dick into her for 2 seconds hahaba besides that like nobody so many first timers well not so many but the majority 
man how would u not know if u had an sti like does what sti does she think u have so are u just not gonna get it 
she doesnt think i have a particular one she just worries one may be dormant no way thats almost insulting 
def 
and like i want her to be happy and things were going so well now shes freaking out over this and getting super upset and quiet she says just thinking about it makes her sick 
j christ man what about fucking trusting u 
she just says you may not have known you got it like im some kind of gigolo 
haha yea what does a test entail 
a scheduled appointment and i dont know probably urine blood samples but its ridiculous 
haha how many people could u have gotten from 
like none realistically anna standing 
shes a real cum dumpster 
i mostly have had things with nice girls most of whom havent done anything and i mean i finger them are my fingers going to get chlamydia 
haha its such a shitty move on her part have u and jacklyn done much yet 
hand stuff but thats as far as its gotten and shes pretty much said its not going farther unless i get tested 
fuck man 
you can see why this is upsetting haha 
yeah def if a girl said this 2 me itd be kinda mad but more like offended 
very offended like i understand that its a serious issue but at the same time its like really you want me to get an sti test thats the most unromantic thing in the world 
haha yea but this is a crazy move 
im just in such a fucking bad spot now 
cuzy its like do u get a test and get more or no more action and no test 
at the same time its like do i really want to put myself through something like that to be with someone who made me do it in the first place 
yeah really 
why cant i ever get one fucking normal relationship like this could end things with us and its so stupid 
yeah man maybe its like she i nervous about having sex so its manifesting itself her this whole sti thing 
yeah and so i want to talk about it more but shes like it seems like youve already made up your mind so there isnt anything to talk about would you get the test in my position if i get it im definitely going to tell her she has to come with me no way im going to be humiliated like that by myself 
haha yeah i feel like it would be worse with her there and if i was in you are spot i would do it i mean its a shitty move but if thats what it takes fuck it i guess i mean i would give her the benefit of the doubt and just be like well its dumb but ill do it if it makes u feel better i aint got shit to hide but on the other hand my fear would be that she is just looking for a reason to end it in that case fuck her if u wanna dump me just do it dont take some weird moral stance also if the test was blood work fuck that shit 
yeah knowing me ill probably end up doing it then shell break up with me a week later over something different im so fucking exhausted dude so exhausted of all this perpetual bullshit i have to go through but yes ill probably do it 
will u have 2 get blood work 
and yeah by myself is probably the way to go i mean probably i dont know im going to look into it 
man i feel bad 4 u these ridiculous situations always seem to find u 
its actually fucked 
have u thought of just dumping her now but then she could be like yeah we broke up because he didnt wanna get an sti test if some one asked her y u broke up 
man its jaclyn ive been crazy for her for years and now im finally with her and it was going so well and i dont want it to end 
u should make her get one 2 fair is fair 
she hasnt done anything with anybody though 
but its symbolic 
true i may do that but i dont know 
haha it would be a weird move i guess maybe just bite the bullet and do it she is doing because she is nervous not because you are a balla haha 
yeah i know it just has me so upset thats why i needed to talk to someone about it 
yeah other than that shit is going well 
yeah its been pretty good she gets a little emotional sometimes when shes pmsing but so does every woman i guess 
haha do u see her on campus 
yeah i have a class with her like we hangout quite a bit and we get along very well and i really do like her but it just seems like she doesnt understand the situations she puts me in ive made it so clear to her that all i want is for her to be comfortable and happy i just wish she made it seem like she wanted the same for me anyway i need to go to bed haha my car battery dies every night now and i need to wake up early to get my neighbor to boss it boost fucking sucks haha thanks for the bro 2 bro bro 
no problem dude and that really does fucking suck haha night did u take it 
man the situation did such a 180 lol 
lol how so 
i talked to her and said that id take the test not because i had doubts but because if thats what it took to make her comfortable then id do it and she immediately apologized and said she didnt care if i got it or not then gave me a bj a few days afterwards 
nice haha now its facebook dog ballla 
things are going really well with her im psyched

pretty good to be honest i ended things with her a couple weeks ago she was just getting way too worked up about things she hated the fact that i drank

haha man i love the fact that mharie hates u its so fucking funny 
she gives me the dirtiest looks ever whenever i happen to see her i have no idea what i did to her lol 
she is the kind of girl who thinks she is a cat she is the kind of person who is so fucking mean for no reason

i forgot to ask did ashley get back to you 
haha nope but she hasnt been online 
broke up with sydney the other day haha 
yo what the fuck what happened 
there were a lot of little things that made me realize i really wasnt enjoying the relationship at all and honestly the entire time it felt like she just wanted sex which is fine but with her being my neighbor she was over like all the time i dont know i couldnt deal haha 
haha how she take it 
baddddddly oh man so bad ive never felt more uncomfortable in my life 
oh shit what she do 
she cried for so long and so loudly with her parents in the next room then she didnt want me to leave so i just sat there while she cried then she got really angry for like 5 minutes then started bawling again right after the entire time she was pretty much begging me not to break up with her and i was just like sorrrrry 
oh fuck thats a shitty feeling thats sounds fucking terrible how long had u guys been dating 
only a month she was really upset that i rushed the relationship so much but i was the one who didnt think we should start dating for a while she was always the one pushing for the relationship plus she talked about her exs so much but wanna know the real kicker 
what 
shes a farter my god does she fart often 
haha u mentioned that she had farted once or twice by accident when u first started seeing each other its funny that it continued 
oh man it was like every time we would hang out id say something funny shed start laughing then pffffffftt 
they smell or was just audio only 
audio only but the audio was definitely turned up all the way like they were so loud she had to acknowledge them 
haha did u or she ever address them 
she said were dating now so its okay if you hear me fart which is true to an extent like i can understand a few poots every now and then were only human but like when it become thats frequent of an event something just isnt right 
haha well atleast she addressed it i hope u didnt buy her lots of shit 
just dinners its just awkward with her right next door now haha i feel like shes gonna break in and murder me 
has she messaged u since the break up 
once saying shes finally accepted everything and that she wants to keep in touch with me

lol what class is it for 
la and it doesnt even count for anything but if we dont do it we lose marks or something i dont even know 
well that sounds entirely logical 
exactly its like any marks we get on it are bonus marks but if we dont do it its marked as incomplete and we lose or something 
whos is your teacher 
ross big tall awkward guy who wanted to perform at coffee house 
oh i know the one 
actually

nice work see that wasnt too hard was it

ruined my day 
ruined my life 
same my world came crashing down 
the harsh truth 
everyone is so disappointed just so we can please the grads 
what why 
what do you mean 
please the grads 
okay heres the thing the grads were supposed to have ugly sweater day today but since school was cancelled theyre doing it tomorrow so naturally they dont want anyone else doing a theme day so to please them we have to cancel ours 
well it makes sense to please 25 instead of 75 its basic math 
exactly would want to please the majority wouldnt very productive homeroom rep meeting you missed out on today probabily the best one yet didnt have one single complaint heck it was the quickest one too

i msgd alex 
mcallistar 
ye 
brilliant 
but he doesnt want to do it 
i messaged kieran he doesnt now who do we pick 
hes back on 
for sure 
hm i am working on it 
this is so much work to do in so little time 
i have the mcs done by tonight 
im hoping kieran will respond tonight but who really knows 
to cool to respond via facebook try messaging him with carrier pigeons 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ill get right on that im sick of it 
of what oh 
you know what im talking about 
ya well he must be too drained 
i think hes just too lazy to be honest 
i think he only notices the work he does and not others work 
he must not notice a whole lot then 
haha well we will see what happens i hope school is cancelled tomorrow 
same i didnt do any homework whoops 
seger said no so apperently alex is doing it solo 
uhhhhh well that should be interesting 
haha it will be kinda funny if he crashes and burns either way it will be good 
are we expecting him to 
hm i dont know kiana doesnt seem to hopeful 
should we be hopeful 
well probably for the karma and all 
im just too tired to think about all the things that could go wrong 
nothing will go wrong 
that is being very optimistic 
well if something does we can just blame seshu daddy 
hell take credit for anything good 
then lets just make it bad lol 
and get yelled at by seshu can you take him in a fight 
ill headbutt him he wont see it coming but i will 
just like an angry bull eh 
thats my middle name 
daniel angrybull lutes has quite a ring to it 
it really does 
good decisions made by your parents naming1010 101 the picture the caption 
what 
the picture nikol shared 
haha the one with liam 
yeeep 
haha too goood 
did you see her comment on the original one 
haha bitch 
haha oh daniel 
it doesnt really look like her in the picture 
i was there when they took it and she was so confused 
who took the photo 
harrison please apply please please please please 
ill consider it 
please karim is 
so is connor 
yeah but does anyone really want connor on 
do you think anna would pick me 
i dont see why she wouldny t 
do you think she will pick you 
i hope so but i dont know 
will she pick grace or nicole 
i highly doubt nikol will get back on but i cant see anna not putting grace back on 
did she not like grace 
no she did like her or at least tolerated her i think 
haha then why not put her on again 
i said i cant see her not putting her on as in i think she will put her back on 
oh double negative 
sorry 
just dont let it happen again 
ill try my best so you never really told me how do you feel about connor and anna 
not good 
why not 
i was hoping for connor or seshu with jack 
same i wouldve been okay with vaishu or whatever her name is too though but jack was my first choice 
yea it should be interesting 
thats one way to put it 
shitty would be another way 
well thats making an assumption but yeah pretty much 
haha more school spirit 
i told one of my friends that wed have more school spirit assemblies probably and she looked at me and said more opportunites to ditch 
badass friend 
dont tell me youve never skipped 
guilty as charged 
for real 
yea day or two pre christmas break 
well everyones done that 
i guess i am not as bad as i thought 
dont worry youre still pretty bad 
good now i feel better 
mission accomplished did you happen to go look at lights hot dangerous i watched some of your video 
i am honored 
you should be 
jkj im noy 
did you actually watch that video 
ive have no already seen it 
good grammar and ah okay 
haha oops 
tsk tsk and you call yourself a level one english student 
i never not said that 
what 
it was a joke 
i didnt understand it 
cause it was bad grammar too keep up erin 
oh double negative sorry daniel 
no problem so what was kiana talking about with jack today 
i have no clue apparently she was super upset after physics and then thats what she was talking to jack about but other than that i dont know you havent gotten it out of jack 
no i wonder why who told you she was upset 
she was outside the office ranting and said she couldnt tell me what was wrong and then haha told me the rest of the info 
does haha know 
yeah it was haha that kiana was ranting to outside the office but she said she wasnt allowed to tell anyone because kiana didnt even want her to know or something 
work it out of her 
i tried i couldnt maybe we can get something out of jack tomorrow 
wow must be a big one do you think it is prom related 
im not sure why it would be such a big deal that none of know then and since when is she close with jack 
i dont know i guess so spooky 
its weird 
i really want to know 
me too but i dont want to force someone to tell me 
i will force haha you should bring it up with jack tomorrow 
when were changing the sign yo bonding time 
realtalk 
we can bring haha and then see what we can accomplish 
but then we couldnt bring jack 
says who it will go a lot quicker with four people because we could do two to a side 
true that always thinking 
efficiency at its finest do you want the drama different drama but still drama 
dish the dirt sister 
well apparently the probability of grace a jchorn going to prom together is quite high at the moment and tyler case got into a fight with dori his date so now might be taking anna youre in for a good night 
proma shit anna and tyler 
what 
promdrama proma 
ah clever mcallister will be mad 
ahaah good 
not a fan 
no are you 
i dont hate him but i dont like him much either i now know what was going on kiana told me today 
what was it 
her and jack are kinda together but you cant tell anyone because catherine doesnt know yet but she told me i could tell you 
since when are they together 
do you want the whole story 
dish itz 
okay here goes so they went to the david myles concert together right and it was super fun and perfect or something and they ended up kissing so then kiana said that it was too soon and they should wait and she didnt know about things she didnt want to do anything because of catherine i think so yeah jack told her that he liked her so yesterday i guess they just talked and all and they decided to just take things slow and see how it goes let whatever happens happen i guess but yeah catherine doesnt know yet so were not allowed to talk about it much 
secret love this is really surprising 
why do you think that 
i dont know i just cant see them dating 
it didnt surprise me that much when i thought back on everything and take into consideration how close they looked in the office yesterday 
true well at least it happened at the end of the year 
imagine if they had dated all year 
or broke up half way through the year 
that would have been a nightmare 
haha well where is kiana going to university 
unb 
well well well when do you think it will be official 
after they tell catherine which they want to do tomorrow and actually maybe shes going to queens 
she should decide soon 
haha apparently 
but who is jack going to prom with 
haha 
and connor 
uhhhhhh haha told me but i cant remember 
get it together 
sorry 
just dont let it happen again 
i remember nikou was going to ask him and he was going to say yes but then someone else asked him before she could 
jun little kwon or irene chan 
jun little maybe i dont even know frig frig frig frig daniel so much drama 
what is it 
catherine is mad at jack and kiana and basically hating on kiana on tumblr and kianas super upset and seshu and i are disagreeing 
haha wow h8ter 
its bad so i know im writing a passive aggressive post and the person its about will see it and know but damn that was an incredibly uncool move and im incredibly hurt right now and i honestly probably cant trust them ever again 
shit 
i know and her and seshu are fighting 
about what 
shut up seshu do you know how hard it was to not tell you any of thisidkvery hardbut even though you hate me please dont give jack a hard time about itof course youll start going on like thathey i havent been your favorite person at all the past few monthsand i like one of your friendsits weirdyou really seem to underestimate how much i care since despite the downright vicious things youve said to me ive continued onbut honestly let me explain why im disappointed in youbecause honestly you can understand why catherine is upsetthen surely you understand that you had to make a descisiongoing for the guy or not upssetting your friendboth are reasonable descisions with positives and negativesyet you sound like youre complaining that somehow the negative of your descision upsetting catherine should not happenwhich is unreasonableis it clear nowyou have too youve ranted about me to like everyone i basically stated what i thought were facts at the timeand im not complaining im just stating that i feel really really bad about the one time i actually have feelings for someoneeven though i really shouldnt especially considering the fact that she hooked up with some other guy a few days before jack broke up with herseshu iyengar left the conversation youre not allowed to tell anyone i tell you all this by the way 
holy fuck seshu is being a dick 
i know i tried to tell him that but he thinks hes being too soft on her 
like he i actually just being really mean for no fucking reason why does he even care 
because hes a jerk who wants to make her feel bad because he doesnt agree with this or soemthing i dont even know 
but since when has he ever taken interest in kianas love life 
well we used to have late night conversations every night about each others love lives but then they got into a fight and we dont anymore until recently 
oh shit a whole other side of seshu where is jack in all of this shit 
hes talking to kiana but yeah jack to kianaif it will make you feel any better i have no regrets about anything ive done in fact im super happy about being with you and i think all of this is worth it 
awee good guy jack 
seshus telling me im only allowed to trust one person who should i pick 
what does he mean 
something about how i can not trust anyone except one person my age and my parents 
haha seems reasonable 
its ridiculous 
he needs to shut the fuck up sometimes he makes me so mad 
i dont know how to deal with him 
just dont 
but hes talking about how the only people he can talk to are me and marco how do i leave him then 
well he seems to just be really mean to you 
but i think i put up with it for too long to escape it now 
slowly stop 
how 
just stop like anyone else like say you have to go 
i hate this 
i dont really get yes whole thing 
me neither even i just know that hes making it really hard to leave yes hes going to bed sign of relieft relief sorry for unloading all that on you 
haha no problem but just wait until tomorrow in homeroom 
why 
shit is going to hit the fan 
i might take a really really long walk i dont want to get in the middle of it 
it will likely be just passive aggressive shit 
all i can say is im glad its the end of the year 
aha yes 
in a way im glad seshu isnt back on 
makes sense 
good night daniel 
but next year is going to be weird for you 
ugh yes no mardi gras no one thats actually funny its gonna be insane 
wait is mardi gras canceled for next year 
oh yeah you werent there yeah thomas came and said that he didnt think the src should do it anymore that some other group will run it 
oh shit 
it sucks but its understandable after everything that happened this year 
yea it was a weird year 
are you glad you were on it 
yeah but only because of you haha and jack 
dont tell me you didnt enjoy changing the sign 
true that sister true that 
we get to train people yes yes yes then were done 
i am just going to give people shit the whole time 
honestly though as bad as it was im glad it was you and jack that i got to change it with and haha lets tell them they need the ladder tho just to make it worse 
ahahahahahahaahh make them bring the box of letters out every time 
well it is karim karly and ben i think and hahahahahahahahahhahahahaha didnt we actually do that once 
ye its was peters tip 
yeah theyre actually going to need the ladder im so glad we listened to him 
haha i have to go lets walk tomorrow in hr 
kk we still have to change one side of the sign by the way 
ffff 
peters orders you still have to send it to me 
it got deleted 
daniel jack and kiana are no more 
why 
jack to kiana i dont think we should keep doing this especially with you going away 
she is going away and there is still a whole summer left 
shes leaving for rome on sunday and then on to iran for a while 
oh well then i quess you gotta do what you gotta do 
guess so 
well they never were facebook official 
very true when kiana told me they were over she said we broke up so i dont know 
well at alex mcallisters party i saw jack sitting on the couch with kira chisholm and they were pretty close together and kiana was looking at them from a distance and looked really sad 
oh i heard about that actually she was quite upset about that but because kira and jack were drunk she let it go or something 
oh really well something like that is never a good sign 
apparently kira is a super emotional drunk 
haha well that party was a fucking shit show anyway 
oh spill 
haha it was just a really fucking weird time like tom jungs face was covered in cake for 2 hours girls were doing body shots off of liam starr i saw some girl throw up pure alcohol on alexs floor 
why was liam starr even there ew gross 
haha i have no idea it was just the outcast of fhs 
why did you go 
well nicole and mia wanted to go so me and richard went and i will admit it was entertaining 
i heard that nicole and junlee and all the asian girls were super drunk 
haha nicole wasnt that bad but junlee was stupidly drunk she is the reason tom jungs face was covered in cake she was also just spilling shit for no reason it was weird 
wow stupid stupid at least they didnt have to go to school the next day like some people 
haha yeah i was still alittle drunk the next day 
not as bad as some people aka the people who were wearing sunglasses insdie aka emily blanchette 
haha yea i heard that some people were stilling doing shots at 7am 
robbie mcgibbon just decided to go to school drunk to see how it was but thats cray haha and i want you to form a band and enter battle

agahahahaha you should have tweet about the election 2 shit never mind u did haha 
haha hey long time no see im working on a paper for sociology and i was wondering if you could give me some perspective from a larger school 
yea dude 
awesome so im looking at three alientaions that occur within schools not so much at x but id like to compare to mcgill one of them that im most interested in in regards to you is the alienation between you and your professors how big are the classes do the profs know your name do you feel there is a barrier between you and them etc etc 
my average class size is like 100 to 150 i know all of my profs by name but would address them by name i can see my profs during office hours but it is rare that people ask questions in class and lectures are a bit of a one way street it is a different dynamic than highschool for sure all and all it seems that its up to the prof how much or little of him you see some profs make them self available at all times others basically hide in their offices and hope no one visits 
so your profs are aware that you daniel lutes exist also do you go to your profs house and get drunk with them because i do 
oh hell no 
to which 
both i mean if i speak to a prof he know i exist in the sense that i am standing infront of him but none of them would know my name the average prof teaches probably 400 students per term so i doublt they even learn 20 of the names 
alrighty good to know thanks buddy i really appreciate it 
no problem baby girl 
have a good one see you in the summer 
yea bye then 
hey buddy lingo time i was wondering if you are free this weekend and if youd be down to hang saturday morning afternoon

hey man when you and jack made that documentary you guys used a shotgun microphone right i was wondering if i could borrow that from you if you arent using it these days because im also making a documentary for english and im looking for audio gear 
hey man we used the shotgun microphone but it was really shit it only recorded in mono what we ended up doing was using a lapel microphone and a little recorder for interviews im not home right now but when i get home later 2nite ill look for all of my shit and give it 2 jack tomorrow 
oh man that would be fantastic thank you yo dog jack told me youre saying mcgill over u of t for cs what are the advantages 
hey man yea i would say that u of t for compsci is still really good it really depends on what you are interested in mcgill cs tends to be more formal meaning a large basis is in maths and theory but it is more practical in later years mcgill cs is also a lot smaller than u of t cs in terms of student population which is nice because you can get to know profs bettter also i dont know if you are interested in ai or machine learning at all but mcgill is the place 2 be if you are interested in that 
okay thats super helpful hey man what is your opinion of the concurrent arts and sciences degree mcgill 
do they even offer that at mcgill i would say that getting 2 bachelor degrees sounds like a good idea but you are probably better off doing a masters instead oh shit do u mean bachelors of arts and science yea i like it it can be hard cause u kinda need 2 split you are brain between the two subjects but it is also nice for that same reason i like it a lot 
yea sorry that was what i meant do you find you wished you had had more electives or was it nice to just get in to your two areas of interest 
well you have 2 do the freshman requirements so u kinda get 2 do some random stuff also 363630 are you are required credit hours so there are 18 credit hours that you can use for electives on top of what electives you take in arts for freshman requirements that said i am using all of my electives 2 take cs stuff 
okay cool thanks dude 
no problem 
hey man so i accepted at mcgill i was just wondering i know there isnt any coop program at mcgill for work placements during the summer but jack told me you got some jobs during the summer how did that work exactly like did you arrange those yourself is there a certain channel at mcgill that you go through to find those work placements let me know i mean like cs related jobs 
generally speaking mcgill doesnt do much to help you find a job but that said if you know where to look there are some good resources there is a website at mcgill called myfuture which has jobs posted on there and you can search for cs related jobs and such i never had much luck looking on there though also some times you will get emails from the cs department about jobs opening at mcgill for small coding projects or with other companies there is also a csengineering job fair held every september and january where a bunch of companies come and you can find out about what they do and give them you are resume and shit that where i got my current job another thing that you can do and where i got the job i had prior to this job is just make a spreadsheet with a list of all the tech companies in the area you want to work in my case i did fredericton and their phone numbers and call them up and ask about openings a lot of places wont post that they are looking for interns because its too much work but they will hire you if you can prove that you would be worth it i would really recommend that you call rather than email because it is a great way to stand out from other people who are just emailing it will take more time but it pays off in the end i was talking to my boss from last summer and he said that the only reason i got an interview was because i called which made me stand out the most important thing for finding a job is just volume apply to as many places as you can even if you feel under qualified for it the worst thing that is gonna happen is they wont respond having a good cs resume is also important you can look around online for some resources for making a good one there is a torrent out there for a book called cracking the coding interview which is a really great read for prepping for interviews in the beginning they mention how to make a cs resume look and what it should contain take the time to work on it cause it can really help u get a job cs degrees are in demand but it can be tough to find a job after first year or even after second year but just be persistent and you will find one once you start getting experience then people will want to hire you i got 6 or 7 offers this summer and thats just because i had experience in the past 
wow okay thanks a lot man super helpful ill probably work at the calithumpians again after first year but this is great to know for future planning appreciate it 
no problem man congrats on getting in by the way 
thanks dude yo dude got another question for you for a cs student is there a certain is that is better like mac vs windows 
mac is better than windows i guess but linux is better than both what i did is install a dual boot onto a windows machine so u can use windows and linux 
hm okay cool never used linux before i know its really finicky what are the main reasons its better 
um basically the command line is us really useful if u install ubuntu which is a flavor of linux it is pretty stable over all it comes down to preference there are people w every is it doesnt really matter that much 
okay cool good to know thanks dude 
no problem 
hey dan just making my course selections and was wondering if you had any suggestions for arts and science in regards to comp sci 
i would take all of your arts sci required courses in first year just to get them out of the way i did math 240math 140math 133comp 202econ 230econ 227comp 206comp 273is what i did in first year i wish i had just done all of my freshman requirements right away tho comp 202 comp 206 comp 250 and comp 273 are all reasonable courses to take in first year 
okay dope cause i was a little taken aback by the lack of first year comp sci options thoughts on math 140 vs 150 
yea 150 is pretty rigorous and mostly math majors i would only do it if u like math a lot it really depends on how good u are at math 
well i took app calculus this year i wouldnt say i love math but 140 would be entirely review then again that might not be terrible when you say rigorous what do you mean 
yea i guess what i would say is that its the same content but you are competing against better students so they have to make the quizes and final more challenging i hear that 150 is really hard because its all kids who are exceptional at math what you could do is sign up for 150 and if u feel like its too hard just switch into math 140 before add drop ends 
hm that sounds pretty bad thanks for the info in terms of formative sciences any that you recommend any that would be more useful for cs are interesting obv comp 202 
i took the environment one esys 104 it was pretty interesting phys 131 was okay 
okay cool i was considering that so good to know 
yea first year is a bit a of grind to be honest like they kinda make u take a bunch of dumb classes but once u hit second year u can start with the good shit 202 and 250 are the comps i would recommend for first year 
okay dope thanks a million man 
ye no problem good luck on exams dude 
you missed a video chat with peter oh my bad dude didny meant to call you 
lol its all good 
didnt get into comp 250 cause it was completely full got into comp 206 instead should i try and switch 
comp 206 is a good course to take in first year i would say 250 is better though 
in what ways is 250 better would you say 
it is more of a continuation of 202 206 is kinda random who is teaching 206 by the way 
i will get back to you on that yeah i would rather take 250 there didnt seem to be a waiting list when i signed up 
some classes dont have waiting lists 
man that sucks ay what kind of calculator will i need for freshman math stuff 
you dont get to use one in math classes for other classes i got the casio fx911 plus c which is pretty good 
okay thanks duder 
lol no problem you move into you are res yet 
yep been here for a few days now 
oh nice 
yeah its alright i ended up in solin so still getting used to cooking my own food and stuff but its alright 
oh damn everyone i know who went to solin ends up being really close w everyone there apparently 
yep its definitely got that vibe ay you got any textbooks i could buy off you for like comp 202 and phys 131 and stuff 
hey man no i usually just torrent my text books 
hey 
yea i set it up today

haha yeah i know d 
hey 
hey im in math 240 i saw your comment in the group and want to compare assignments i am not super confident in my venn diagram or in 5c do you want it in pdf or word 
yo dude just getting properly started in the assignment but heres what ive got so far 
have you taken a look at 5c yet 
nope trying to finish an is assignment and prepare for a chinese test first then ill jump to 5c is the rest of it pretty easy 
the rest took like 20 min but im stuck on 5c one sec ill send it 
sweet thanks also my girlfriend looked at the diagrams and shes doing her masters in maths here d 
well that is a strong endorsement i am a u0 and am beginning to feel out of my depth haha 
haha if you finished the rest so quickly i think youll be fine what is your major 
im artsci so compsci and econ are my majors what about you 
comp sci 1 year left well 2 years including this one 
cool whats a fun comp sci class i should take in the future or is that an oxymoron 
haha they can be fun d the early on ones maybe not so much 
im in comp 202 right now and its kinda lame 
yup it used to be awesome i helped teach it last year when it was still awesome lol or no fuck that mightve been two years ago no it was last year comp 529 was nice though 
haha i havent gone to many of the classes it may not be that bad ahaah 
not sure about now the teachers are lacklustre now used to have a much better one 
my prof is a phd candidate 
tremblay 
no his name is juan camilo gamboa higuera 
dunno him 
he seems like he is doing his best haha are u planing on meeting up with the others after class tomorrow 
not sure i might need to finish this is assignment and i wont be able to make class because ill still be doing my thing at a regulvar training session 
regular training session 
regulvar its a building automation company im doing a training session working on building mesh networks for home automation systems but itd end up competing with regulvar and delta machines so im getting to know their product and marketing strategy better 
so are you working for them 
no just attending the session with a laboratory no my laboratory one in concorida who were kind enough to let me join in whatre you hoping it do with comp sci 
ideally a start up maybe grad school not a whole lot of direction what about you 
not sure yet maybe grad school kind of want to do a biophysics phd 
fuck man that is intense 
youd be surprised actually d sounds intense isnt all that hard mostly just a matter of understanding libraries and piecing things together in a useful fashion 
well at least it sounds impressive do you know where you want to go to grad school 
sure as hell sounds impressive yeah d um not really wherever they wont force me to take classes d my girflriend started her phd in vienn and they didnt have to take classes there thatd be sweet 
thats really cool do u wanna be a prof 
thatd be sick but starting my own company would be nice the mesh networking stuff is interesting and its applications to building automation and control is interesting biochemistry and biophysics startups are rare but it would be something to examine any idea what sort of startup youd want to do 
not a clue hopefully it will hit me before i finish my undergrad degree haha 
haha id imagine it will startups are getting popular at mcgill 
really have u ever done a hackathon here 
never as a participant but i have monitored and helped organise onee 
oh cool do a lot of people attend 
yup 
they seem cool anyways im gonna keep looking into 5c hit me up if u find an answer also should we say we worked together like he asked or is that something that isnt really done 
uh we can say we compared answers for correctness we didnt really work together on it d 
true just send me yours when you finish it 
sounds good will be comparing to yours again when im done havent looked at your answers just yet need to figure out this stuff d and not fail the course 
haha yea good luck pahah 
thanksee have a good night dude 
u 2 
did you end up meeting with the other 240 people 
no i had a class after it i dont know if they met have you looked at 5c yet 
not just yet hoping to get there tonight 
alright hit me up when you get it 
yo 5c is on the boards now i got fuckin stuck on a typo for ages 
yeah i figured it out today have you finished yet 
im at this point very close just the set idenities stuff to do which im about to finish and then print and then turn the sucker in you already printed 
yes i wrote mine up on latex yesterday it took so long 
haha d latex takes a while to get used to 
yeah definitely i figured i might as well learn it now 
i remember i learned latex because i had to d a document i was working on simply got too big with too many citations and figures for word to handle 
haha did u use the template he gave us 
no already have a template i made for myself last year want me to send it your way 
haha it made formating kinda hard 
its pretty simple 
sure dude 
ill be adding it to the sleek latex templates group soon 
there is a sleek templates group ahhahahaahah 
theres this set of templates httpwwwlatextemplatescom and then i maintain another set of templates because i got pissed off at how they choose to define their templates making them hard to modify 
hey man have you looked at assignment 2 yet 
nope whens it due dont tell me tonight 
haha not till next thursday 
oh phew ill look at it tomorrow d you started it 
httpwwwmathmcgillcavettamath240dirh2pdf 
and im plannign on not doing it last minute this time 
does q 3 b 
seemed like a novel concept to try out 
what does the sign mean is question 2b does it mean divides by 
is divisible by for any x y show 4 is a factor of x2 y2 x and y are both not odd we think yup 
okay that makes sense i have never seen that sign b4 haha i started the assignment questions 25 are pretty easy but 1 and 6 were tough for me how long do you think it will take to get our mark back 
for the first assignment maths usually has the grades within a week or two 
not bad do we get it on my courses 
yup d 
yo have u done anywork on the assignment 
starting just now 
let me know when u finish 4 and 5 i wanna compare answers also in case u werent in class we got assignment 1 back 
when yesterday 
no it was friday i think 
wow wait we have class on fridays thats no on my schedule d 
ahahahhahahahaha yeah man 
fuck my life 
every fridat 
so there are 3 class per week 
yeah thats why every class is an hour long 
lulz i need to amend my calendar oh yeah there it is d look at that 
haha clearly but yeah he gave the assignment back i think everyone did well on it from what i saw 
oh good he said i skipped too many steps in one of my solutions but that it should be okay my girlfriend will be helping me finish up the other parts this afternoon are we allowed to design an algorithm to prove no problem for number one or is there a better way 
basically you just say that the answer can be checked in polytime and say why he isnt looking for a super rigorous proof 
cool also have you looked at the past midterm looks like this is one of the classes where the assignments are deadly and the tests are pretty straightforward ya think they want something like this 
yeah i took alook at the midterm and it didnt look bad at all you are answer for 1 is really indepth i showed him mine and it was like 3 lines and he said it was good 
haha wellp mine should work then d 
haha oh sure it will 
just finished dunno if youll want to do a last minute compare on your side here it is if you do sorry its so damned late 
haha i already printed mine 
fingers crossed method it is 
yo have u started assignment 4

yea httpwwwcreativebloqcomwebdesignfreewordpressthemes712429 from that list pick a couple of templates that u think would be good for the site i can make specific changes to any template just pick a couple so i can get a sense of the style you want for the site 
true will do when i get home also here is the info for  website username admin pass xjfn7kwbnbv7e5fs if u just wanna poke around and see how it works 
okay thanks did the last webdev do an exit report 
i dont think so but heres the exit report for vice president comms and i highlighted headings that might be relevant for you 
okay cool thanks 
also for the wordpress template i think the topcover photo part of hemingway is p nice and the body of panoramica is good for actually putting info on the page httpandersnorensethemeshemingway httpdemoscpothemescompanoramicapro 
okay cool i am at work right now ill take a look at these this weekend also do u like this site httpsusubcca 
damn dats clean like the template looks good but our  website will have way more info than that one also looks like a lot of other wordpress themes but i guess all the free ones all looks similar anyways 
yea true if you see any site other styles let me know 
hey so when would you be able to start working on the website it should start fairly soon because its nearing school year and freshmen are probabily starting to look at tit it 
yea i can start this weekend are you free some time saturday to talk more about the redesign

kk hey do u know the ftp password 
whats that 
its the file transfer protocol password for the site the old webdev would know 
damn lemme ask the username and password are the same as the website login apparently 
i checked and it isnt 
lol ofc try this username  all capital password d5zkrwamc5xrytbr2npm48b6 
that didnt work haha that response sounded really sassy lol i was at work and didnt want my boss to see me on facebook so i wrote it quick are you asking the former web development about the passwords 
no i didnt think that lol yea i emailed but apparently he had a lot of issues working so i dont know im asking around tho hey i forwarded u the email from the past web designer for tfp password i think its the same password u tried tho if it doesnt work try emailing him back 
yea i tried it and it didnt work ill talk to the guy and see whats up thanks 
alright let me know how it goes this proj needs to start before august 
hey the godaddy password doesnt work either could you get me the proper password for that i think i could reset the ftp password on godaddy by the way i got the password from the exit report 
i think only marvin the past web designer knows the godaddy one sorry i couldnt be much of help the past vice president comms didnt leave me too much to work with lol can u email him and if he doesnt reply ill scavenge for his number 
okay no worries i just sent him an email so we will see what he says 
okay marvin for your information lol 
lol still havent got a reply from marvin anyway you could find the login information 
lol will get back to u today can you try this for godaddy godaddycommunicationssusmailmcgillcaburnsidebasement2016 and if not marvins is 5144630748 
thanks ill checkout it out yea it didnt work but can you search the  email for any receipt sent from godaddy and forward it to me 
ugh i did 
hey there should be an email in your inbox if you follow the link you should be able to set the password up and change it to what ever you want the email only works for 2 hours then it dies if the email fails let me know i will activate it again 
did it 129555976 username password is chickennoodle25 
haha nice password thanks 
woohoo did marvin help or no 
no havent heard from him since i called him mark lol 
haha 
uh i didint know that godaddy didnt do our hosting it looks like they only license us the domain do you know who hosts our site 
um no i dont know what a host site is wordpress 
no probably not hosting is basically what company owns the server that our site sits own because its address susmcgill mcgill may do the hosting 
ah have u texted marvin i dont think anybody in  exec would know 
no not yet was he the web development last year or 2 years ago 
last year 
oh shit how come he doesnt know any of the passwords also is he the guy you guys had a problem with 
dude i dont know web designers werent too great in the past i think so i think there were problems with both to be honest but dont tell other execs i said this if u come across them lol 
lol ya no shit ill text marvin and see if he responds haha thanks 
okay good luck 
hey i talked with marvin and he told me that i should talk to computer task force is there a specific person there who deals with  is there a contact you can give me to talk to 
ah makes sense i know the chairprez is francisco but i dont know their contact ill go into the office today and figure out 
thanks

oh ya he didnt send yet will do soon yo u r in science right 
art sci 
okay good haha i found small things to be changed in about us 1 senatornot senators and externalphilanthropic events to sustainability events 
kk 
yo do u think u will want to use indesign or photoshop for any of the work 
probabily not why 
our vice president internal is ordering it and was wondering but thats fine 
kk i already have photoshop so its all good 
yo so prep 101 wants to design a new ad for the website what do u think is an appropriate size of the ad if its going to be a rectangular one also can u change the photo of frosh on home page to this httpswwwfacebookcomscienceorientationweekphotosa52554543417465310737418275255385408420091183366851725838type1theater and in the box write 70 sold out click on the photo to register 
for the prep 101 thing i would say tell them to make it over 1500 px in its smallest dimension also you should get them to make the picture landscape it will look better on the site like that 
i think they want height and width 
lol yea make it width 2000 px height 1000 px 
reminder to change the photo on the home page also can u look over the academic portfolio events and revise the changes according to the doc i sent u some of the committees names are wrong 
sorry forgot about the image thing its up now ill look at the academic portfolio stuff later 2nite 
okay thanks hey are you busy right now i am about to ask a smallish favour 
i am working right now whats up 
im writing the  listserv and would like another banner than the one already there 
yea sure i can do it now 
it looks like this right now but i would like the photo to be the one from the website and the font of listserv to be something more appealing lol thank u so much 
so this is for the listserv not the site right 
yea which is why this is a favour because i currently dont have a graphic designer 
oh yea sure no problem do you want the logo 
yes it has to be there i will sent u one 
okay great 
i sent u an email of the drop box with all the logos  logo masterpsd is the one needed but i wasnt sure it was a vector 
okay what dimension do you want for the image 
600px wide x any height 
do you know what font is used in the logo 
asking around right now 
i figured it out 
okay 
actually never mind i thought that i found it but it is different 
does it look fine honestly the font is so ugly i wouldnt care if its not the exact same 
lol true ill email it to u 
or i can ask other execs if i can just include the red logo and not the big  word so that everything can be in diff font 
its fine i think 
okay 
kk i sent it 2 you are gmail if there are any changes let me know 
did u send it to comms email i dont see it 
no i sent it to you are gmail 
my personal gmail 
ya i just replied to you are dropbox share email

sure hey man here it is httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvhcf4vkhd68yfeatureyoutube 
thanks man 
no problem 
how do u like video hi daniel 
hey man 
hey 
im still not entirely sure of the entire scope of web development position in a general sense i am willing to do anything that is to say that i dont really have anything i would like to avoid in terms of my current skills i am probably a little more geared towards front end i feel like dividing the tasks will be a lot easier when there is a list of all of the duties what about you what is your preference things you dont want to do 
im interested in working on internal tools for editors so basically extending bert but other than that i tend to shy away from front end agreed about having a list though plus well probably end up having some overlap depending on whos more free in a given week 
yeah that makes sense so i guess for the meeting we can say i am front end and u are back end just so people can get a general sense of our roles 
looooooooool that font on the exit report p 
haha 
hey i cant find where i wrote down the port number were supposed to use to ssh into tribble do you still have it by any chance 
yea i have it somewhere one sec 
awesome thanks 
i dont have the port number written down so i assume that it is 22 
sweet it worked thanks 
no problem hey claire julia forwarded an email to me and you about site speed and the 502 error we are getting sometimes how did you want to split up the work i worked on site speed for a couple of hours tonight so did you want to take on the 502 bug i am not sure if the 502 and the site speed are correlated but either way i am cleaning out a bunch of junk from word press 
hey daniel i have a bunch of internship events that are going to keep me busy until friday and then have a camping trip this weekend so other than thursday afternoon i probably wont be able to spend a ton of time on this until monday in the meantime your plan sounds good i was looking a bit into 502 errors and it looks like they do happen occasionally with wordpress sites hey how are the site speed issues going i suspect that the 502 error is happening because of a php request timeout so if we solve the site speed problem the 502 error should hopefully go away from the sql queries it looks like most of the huge drains on time are coming from the current theme so it might be interesting to see what happens if we set up the new theme on the development server 
things are going well with the site speed although the more i look into the code base the more of a mess i seem to find i was wondering if the theme was slowing things down do you know if will has started on adding the theme to the development server 
hey hope your summers been going well when i went through our servers logs to figure out what the heck was going on with the 502 error and it turned out that some neerdowell was spamming the site with post requests to an obscure wordpress phone app php file when i blocked the ip addresses that were sending all of those requests the 502 error seemed to go away so i think we should be good on that front in terms of the redesign will made a child theme on the development server and i made a google doc with all the stuff that julia wants us to do on it before we publish to production i was going to try to fix the about page tonight and then pick off some other items tomorrow i shared the google doc with your online editor account 
sweet thats really weird tho damn kids and theirs cellphones ill take a look at the doc tomorrow is everyone just doing a chunk of the work on the google doc 
yep i dont know how much more will is going to be doing with the redesign but basically i colour coded all of julianataliewills todos based on what we still need to get done so we can just claim specific things as we go 
hey what is the login and password for httpdevmcgilltribunecom 
24rtrbssh with sq at the end should be in the exit report pwrd sheet 
yea okay thats what i thought i have that here but i wasnt able to login what is the user name 
this is for root i think if you want gitusr its 24rtrbgitsq 
hm yea those are the credentials i am using and i cant get in 
this is for ssh right not for the wpadmin page because wpadmin is the same as for the regular website 
oh sorry i should have been more clear this is the for when i view the site on chrome it asks for a username and password 
oh that is tribune and gilmeyer also i was going to chilldo worktalk to julia about the webiste in the tribune office at 4 if youre free 
4 tomorrow 
yep1 yep 
yea sure thing see you then hey i got the become a photographer thing fixed as well as the thing that was showing up on the bottom of the page 
awesome i was out picking up my desk chair so i could sit down while i worked so i havent started on the alternate image yet okay i fixed the thumbnail issue very hackily but it does work basically i replaced the current default thumbnail in the parent themes images folder with the tribune logo hey i switched the theme to the new one 
okay great 
hey are you heading over to the tribune office soon hey i think the changes you made to get captions working might have messed up the photo positioning check out julias comment in the slack

haha shitty no i didnt have that

hey daniel this is mharie what does ideology have to do with anything thats in little red riding hood tell me because im blonde and cant think properly 
lrrhs ideology meant that she valued her grandmother enough to visit her 
okay thank you thats silly but okay is anyone other the the wolf marginalized 
the women for being inferior 
well when you put it like that it seems like a negative way to refer to the fairer sex danielle 
its the stories point of view not mine 
suuuurrrreee thats what you want us to believe no i know that but its more fun for me if i ignore that fact id 
haha all that being said men are superior 
says a man who thinks that the sun is the brightest star 
relitivly of coarse but yes 
relatively aside i am right and you are wrong and i probably wont forget that until highschool is over weird things stick jaclyns a brat an logged me off sigh by the way tis mharcy 
mharcy what about mharie 
nope jaclyn ate herno she just doesnt accept anything bu mharcy now so she wont let me type my name

its a typo 
damn it facebook 
i know all of the deception in this world its just to much 
down with facebook 
okay here are the things that i took down from the meeting that concern you arrive 530 for the staff i dont know about you and the risk management thing though staff skit i think youre now the msn logo i would talk to max about the butterfly wings lullabies meg and dan make cleaning groups friday night mia meg dan meg and dan in charge of boundariesthere might be more but thats all i wrote down i think someone sent out some sort of updated scheduel too so check your email see you tomorrow so it turns out that it wasnt a picture from cisv she taught them at tnb and it was a picture from that so that mysterys solved how did the rest of the meeting go 
haha oh um it was good we scraped the coookie thing but we are having a movie night 
really awesome do we know what movie yet 
no we cant decide 
we should watch something scary 
haha yeah like a really bad horror movie 
haha good idea but something tells me not everyone will probably go for that 
haha yeah probably not 
do we even know when it is yet 
no 
yeah i didnt think so we should do it soon though 
yeah they are deciding weather it should be before or after christmas 
for sure i also like the christmas party idea 
yeah 
i was wondering if you could also check my mark on my english exam for me when you check yours i already told mr milner thanks again for everything 
haha no problem so i should ask him wednesday next week 
yeah whenever you get yours 
haha okay so are u packed for new zeland 
i just have a few things but its pretty much ready how are your exams going 
haha i had a art exam today iit was easy and i have a bbt exam tomorrow are u worried about going 
haha lucky yeah im a little worried about making friends and i think the school work and all that but im trying to keep a positive attitude about it im hoping ill be able to keep in touch with skype and facebook the most important thing is that we got our visas today so were officially allowed to go that was really stressful 
haha is the school you are going to christian 
not as far as i know but i dont think it is cause its a public school by the way how did movie night go 
oh its a 6 out of 10 
yes okay what was bad about it 
um it easnt bad but i could have been better maybe it was a 7 
okay well thats better than i expected who all went 
a lot of litlle kids 
not surprised frankly its probably going to be like that for a while 
yeah hey mia mr milner gave me you are mark on friday u got 93 and on you are survey thing u got 100 
thanks so much for that really didnt expect 100 wow anyways how are things going everything good in fredericton 
haha same old deal how is new zeland 
its really nice and warm i live right in the downtown today i saw my new school and bought some of my uniform by the way do you have skype 
thats sweet yeah it daniellutes2

holly cow how is you are school made any friends yet i got you are report catr but mme pineau said she email you are marks to you are parents my adress is 75 coburn dr e3b 6z7 oh and i went on ebay and bought some antartican money i have quite the collection 
schools really easy actually i know everything weve done so far ive made a few friends people are pretty nice i still miss everyone in fredericton though yeah i didnt know my mom sent an email sorry about that i didnt even know there was such a thing as antartican money that so cool what does it look like so wait how many countries do you have now 
after all of my ebay purchasces i have around 65 
wow thats a lot i wonder if you can get all of them 
yeah north korean money is in the mail 
thats so cool i have a friend from the maldives here ill ask her if she has some money from there for you 
haha my colection is like the snowball effect 
haha yeah she has some so ill send it with the new zealand ones 
nice hey mia first of all ihear you are okay which is great to here and secondly the lebanon summer camp got moved to cec republic so im appying 
awesome thats so great i hope you have an awesome time and if you have any questions just ask by the way i probably wont be able to send you the money for a while since i dont know when the postal system will start working again also schools cancelled so i probably wont get the money from the maldives from my friend either sorry 
haha no problem haha how long are u out of school anyway 
were not sure but they said at least until march 14th i think well have to be relocated because our school suffered so much damage 
wow that is crazy hey do they have winter in new zeland 
yeah its when our summer is but it only gets to like 2 degrees at the coldest so if it snows at all theres a snow day 
haha thast so sweet so how are u find the school work easier or harder 
its so easy i almost wish it was harder but i think its just cause theyre reviewing from last year its funny i was really convinced that it was going to be super hard 
haha yeah that is weird so is chirstchurch super christian 
no the name is very deceiving isnt it its actually just like any other city and stuff well it was i was a little scared when my parents said we were going there but its okay so i did find some religiousness in christchurch im temporarily going to a cristian school until my other school is repaired 
haha wow how christian is it 
well i thought it was gonna be really bad on the first day because there was a lot of praying and hymns and stuff but today we only prayed once and read one psalm still a bit too much for me but its only for a little while it just feels wierd 
haha yeahdo they make u do it 
not really i just kinda put my head down and mumble when they say amen so how are things in freddy 
haha well i am actually in maine right now but last time i was in freddy it was the same old thing 
haha just as expected so i hear that the agmjb elections are on sunday i heard you were running for juniour cher do you wanna cocher 
hey mai i just got your letter today haha thanks a lot how long ago did you send it as for the junior cocher thing megan asked me already but i would rather run with you 
haha i think i sent at least 3 weeks ago or something aw too bad are you running with megan then 
i kinda want to tell megan that i said yes to you a month ago maybe that will work 
yeah sure i kinda remember talking about it a while ago anyways so go for it hey what do you want to do about booking flights for sbtf max said that he and santana traveled together and he also said that he went he paid for his ticket first and then cisv reimbursed him afterwards 
yeah that sounds good to me when do you want to book 
okay i checked out that seat sale thing that the njr told us about but its not really worth it cause we have to fly out of moncton and theres a connection in ottawa which will make it harder to travel for us i checked the air canada website and its 169 bucks for direct flights each way so personally id rather just pay the extra money haha anyways i think we should just wait until we find out more info on sbtf to book the flights we dont want to take advantage of the sale thing 
yeah i agree 
okay sweet 
when do you want to do the skype check in with njr didnt see your message oops 
haha 
i have wirk at 5 so how long do you think the meeting take 
i dunno but i had to go at 6 anyways i cant see it taking more than 2 hours do you want to start earlier though 
yeah like 230 
yeah sure are you gonna go to school on friday 
when do wefly 
our flight leaves at like 11 something 
then no are you 
yes i dunno probably not though 
i have art and pd so i wont be missing much 
haha yeah i have english but i think were just editing our essays i can just get you to read it hahajk 
haha 
hey if i end up going to kensington market do you want me to get you that shirt you wanted if i find it 
haha no its cool good luck 
thanks are you talking to richard right now 
haha yeah 
haha i could just sense it 
haha or u are skying with him 
maybe or maybe im just psychic 
doubtful

madeline this is going to be big

muahahah merry christmas 
lol and a happy new year 
speaking of new year richard told me you are cohosting chinese new year this year 
haha yeah thats the plan httpwwwfacebookcomcisvcompliments 
this is weird 
i want to know who it i is 
do you think they are canadian 
its very possible but i was thinking it was this person from new zealand because they had this christchurch compliments thing a while back and it was very similar but it doesnt really add up 
hm i want to figure this out 
me too but it could be someone we dont know which would suck 
i thinks its a girl based on the cover photot 
haha thats a good point 
it may also just be a cover up pun 
haha puns i think the canadian theory is a good one because they added me so they must know me 
i looked through their friends list and they are mostly canadian 
i have a theory that its amy ayer but its too soon in the investigation to tell or julia 
also this person is friends with steve urchison and are friends with past njrs of other countries 
yes and our mutual friends are all canadian except one who is a new zealand njr 
spooky 
do we have an agenda for the meeting

nothing when she was done i was like okay anything else its kinda weird to respond to 
oh my gosh thats so awkward did she like talk to anyone after

i dont expect anything less heads up connie macdonnie is only doing the last show 
looks like i am only going to the first two 
lol 
who is playing his role in the first 2 
connor grey 
how is he 
uh hes alright i guess i mean hes not gonna ruin the show but im a bit worried and i think he will improve a lot before the show 
really how big is the roel role 
its not big but its the kind of role that its really important if its done right spoiler alert he has the last line in the show 
haha well hopfuly it gets better 
i think it will things always pull together towards the end 
has there been any big director freak outs yet 
hm i guess you would have to define freakout but no during rehearsal episodes yet 
haha did it happen last year 
i cant remember so i guess that means no but we had david smith with us last year and he really pulled robbie back a lot i think the power is going to his head a bit especially since the crucible was so successful last year 
thats what he needs 
haha i just hope we can all hold it together until the show 
aha i have heard he is hyperemotional so good luck 
lol did you hear that from me ive been able to handle it so far so fingers crossed 
both you and anna told me is he still going to theater school 
lol yeah his auditions are in a few weeks 
where does he want to go 
just like various theatre schools in ontario york george brown sheridan 
does he just do one audition 
yeah i think hes sending a video for one but he basically just flies over there and does auditions for each school 
thats cool do you think he will get into any 
yeah i think he will but its more a matter of if he can stay in apparently its like super cut throat and you can get asked to leave at any time if they dont think youre doing much or not getting along with people 
holy shit thats crazy sounds like unb loljk 
lol oh my god totes unbcutthroat do you know who ally ingalls is 
no who is it 
well shes like this theatre girl from freddy beach and she got kicked out of york cause she wasnt getting along with the other actors 
wow i cant find her on facebook

sorry man 
just dont let it happen again

lol i know its all i kept seeing httpswwwfacebookcompageseastsidefamilyesf194616610638556 
been on this page before love it 
lol i should have known 
favourite site how is the campaign going 
uh okay i guess we should skype sometime about it i need some guidance i think hey you awake 
lol yea 
lol can i get you to read my valedictorian speech 
sure 
k be honest with what you think theres this old clich that i heard somewhere saying high school is supposed to be the best four years of your life i always thought this was a terrible thing to say because one what kind of adult tells a kid that their best years happen when theyre fourteen to eighteen and then its all downhill for the rest of your life from there and two i have never heard a single adult say this in my entire life which leads me to believe that its probably not true and thats a good thing because it means that it only gets better from here at least i hope so i wouldnt know none of us know i guess since for most of us the public school system is pretty much all weve ever known when i was younger i always thought that even if i didnt know what i wanted to do then that id of had it figured out by the age i am now now that i am that age i have definitely disappointed my younger self because i still feel like theres a lot of things i need to know before i enter this so called real world filled with adults and jobs and other boring things every year weve all looked back on how much weve changed from grade to another and i always thought that would end when you became an adult however as ive gotten older ive realized one thing not only do you not have it all figured out when youre eighteen but you may not even when youre 25 or 30 and even beyond that in fact in all likelihood you probably will never have figured out everything that there is to know about life and i used to think that was a bad thing but i dont think so anymore because it means even if our dreams and goals change and no matter what happens as long as we learn from our mistakes and grow from our experiences we all have the ability to become the people that we want to be i guess what im trying to say is that even though school may be over it doesnt mean that we are done learning now weve all made it through this far and whether youve enjoyed high school or not graduation will be the last time we will all together be in one place and whether youre scared or excited about the new chapter beginning in your lives from here on out we will all be separating onto very different paths and its likely that well never see some of each other ever again so as we reflect on our years together as we have watched each other grow up i hope we can appreciate what we have learned from our teachers parents friends and fellow students and that we continue to learn and change and grow i hope that everyones future is everything they dreamed it would be and heres to finding a new best four years in your life thank you and congratulations class of 2013 
what is your time limit 
3 minutes its a bit short but i dont know where to add things 
i liked the conclusion the most maybe start with a joke 
thanks i was thinking that but im not really sure what i should joke about haha 
911 that will go over well 
lol oh my god why didnt i think of that 
lolms when is the speech 
i have to hand it in on tuesday morning and then we present same day as src elections which is thursday right 
ya so who is running

yes i dont really think im gonna win so not really at least i got to say it once i guess i do really want to win though 
you just want a platform to address your grade 
lol yeah i guess so ive wanted to run for a while i just thought itd be fun 
its kinda weird that its a thing you run for 
yeah but when you think about it it makes sense cause youre supposed to be representing them also the person with the highest mark could really hate public speaking

yeah we still have to go and present which kinda sucks but whatever at least its not an exam oh and i havent started studying for bio yet so that exams gonna be a shitshow 
i fell the same way about bio too i really dont want to take it next year 
yeah its pretty bad sleeping in class doesnt help either but id take it so you dont close any doors for yourself 
save your tests so i can cheat 
lol yeah ill give you my chem notes too did i tell you that im taking physics next year and i didnt even take it this year 
i didnt know you were taking it next year have you picked all of your courses for next year 
lol they pretty much chose them for us which really sucks cause i couldnt take any electives 
none 
well they were like its not recommended for first year they even said we shouldnt have a part time job 
hm are you going to keep yours 
lol yeah cause all i do is homework there anyways so its probably worth it that is if they give it back to me in the fall 
haha oh did anything overcome out of the breast feeding scandal 
haha well i was terrified to go to work that saturday but the only thing that happened was that there was a lady that was mad that wanted to write something in the comment box but she was actually pretty nice about it apparently is was worse like the day after the story came out but i didnt have to deal with much 
haha the other day some one told me they heard you and another person in the band hallway and talking about prom and you mention that i was going with nicole and this person said i wish i was going to prom with daniel who was it 
lol sorry to disappoint but i do not recall talking about that with anyone who said they overheard 
dejon 
was it like in the hallway or the bandroom 
hallway 
haha i honestly dont remember that at all and i feel like i would remember that too 
this was like 2 weeks ago 
hm okay let me thinkk no honestly i dont think anyone said that to me cause if they did then i feel like i would have tried to remember it so i could tell you later lol 
haha are we done being cochairs yet

haha just tell them to 
okay ill get on it tomorrow so tired right now did a note with richard earlier lol

did you know richard smokes weed now haha 
lol yeah he told me what do you think 
haha what do you mean 
i dunno i thought you might have an opinion on it haha daniel lutes likes kill bill 
haha yea i think it is probably for the best calm him down a bit but last night we were smoking he took like 2 hits and was like man i am feeling it right now 
haha yeah i think hell be fine as long as he doesnt over do it 
i hope he life is ruined by it i really do his 
ahahahahaa just start peer pressuring him and maybe itll work out 
haha ill bring some meth to prom and make him smoke it 
haha and just him no one else 
haha we still need to find a cliff to sit on the edge of 
haha yeah i know havent found one yet but theres that tree by my house 
haha that might just have to do 
its like a cliff but instead of there being a cliff theres branches 
trees seem more dangerous which isnt always a bad thing

where did you find this 
i was looking at the cisv new zealand junior board group and it came up as suggestions cause a girl i know from the nz group is in it 
haha fuck 
and then when i clicked it theres like 100 other groups just like it in the suggestions i had no idea shit like this still existed 
this is the tip of the iceberg are you in fredericton yet

oh sweet lets go 
kk oh i forgot to tell you one last thing by the way 
ill be on skype soooon 
haha kk do you have grant oyston on facebook 
no why 
i just wanted your opinion on his online persona 
what is it like 
its difficult to describe but its like social media guru meets borderline middle age person and he always comments on his own stuff where he is often the only one commenting but then other people like the comments so im confused 
haha self comments are so middle aged 
haha so true i almost wish you could add this guy so you could see cause hes like 22 
he has always struck me as a weird guy 
thats funny cause i never really remembered what he was like in person and now that i see him on facebook it makes me curious oh and this httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid10201662508194291setat1020163472373969710737418251526977941100002642513388type1theater

tcaaaaaaaamppp 
aahhahow 
it just showed up on my newsfeed haha 
what is tommy camp rank on the mia x10 hot or nott scale 
haha do you want all together or pure looks 
both sides of the coin 
haha well after seeing this picture i dont think he deserves anything less than an 11 lets get real here 
haha tcamp is a reall buck 
tcamp gets allllll the bitches 
he has the sexy mysterious side 
haha it compliments his physics major quite nicely 
tommy has a phd in dogs 
haha what can he say he just loves animals 
he definitely has 900 black labs 
lol hes a breeder but he doesnt sell them he just likes breeding them for fun 
that sick twisted fuck 
hes crazy but thats what the ladies really go for these days 
what was the other story u wanted 2 tell me 
skype now its a short one not really a story 
i cant skype now i am about 2 sleep 
lol me too so ill just tell u have you seen the wire 
yes yes yes 
how is it 
so good 
haha okay i was wondering cause ive only seen the first episode and i dont really have a good feel for it is it suspenseful 
the more you watch the bettter it gets it is kinda suspenseful but not in a classic way 
okay okay yeah cause me and my friend were watching it together but it didnt really catch our attention at first but ill definitely keep with it for a bit oh my god this girl i knew in new zealand just made this super out of character status 
it is considered the best tv drama ever who are you watching it with what was it 
really then im definitely watching it i was with my friend richard from cisv haha one sec ill paste it its long but i really thought it was a joke at first hey guys i know i just moved to wellington and established a life here but i have some unfortunate news about things that have been happening i have to move back to christchurch due some on going problems with addiction you will probably hear the rumors floating around school in a couple of weeks as to why this sudden move so i might as well say it and admit to my own problems and how i have screwed my own life upi am addicted to legal highsthis has been why i so moody and reserved from people i hope my friends and family will support me and take this seriously i will try and stay in touch with all my amazing friends that i have made in wellington and hopefully one day be able to move back and go to university here but for now i need to look after myself to make sure i can become the best person i can be i really hope people do take me seriously as although i normally would try find humor or a sliver lining in this kind of situation i really cant i love you all and hopefully i get better soon xxxxx 
it reads like a fake status kinda what kind of girl was this 
well i thought she was like a good kid cause she went to this really expensive all girls school and stuff and she was best friends with this other girl i knew who was pretty straight edge if you see what im saying but i guess she moved to wellington and maybe she got with the wrong crowd 
i want to creep this girllink me 
lol yeah sure one sec httpswwwfacebookcomgretaevans351hclocationstream but like judging from the comments its a real status oh my god okay she just said it was fake lol i was like what the fuck 
haha called that shit 
haha yeah youre the professional 
i googled legal highs and this was the first story though httpwwweconomistcomnewsleaders21583270newzealandsplanregulatedesignerdrugsbettertryingbanthemandfailingnew 
haha nice thats a pretty devious hacked status if ive ever seen one

haha now she had a damage control status up 
haha paste it here 
of corse just a few things that needs to be cleared up1 im not moving back to chch2 i dont have an addiction3 im sorry to everyone who believed the status and messaged me it was really thoughtful4 someone managed to get onto my account and it was stupid of me to have not logged off and im making sure it wont happen again5 im sorry for anyone one was offended message me if you have a problem

wow did not see that one coming how did it go httpsfbcdnsphotosgaakamaihdnethphotosakash41000969101518690477782581798976898njpg 
aghaha did she have a kid 
lol i dont think so since she hasnt been preggers in her pictures haha a guy in my psychology class had this shirt on today 
oh god haahahah how is university anyway 
lol yeah its pretty bad hes also that guy that asks the teacher about psychological theories in the middle of class like he knows everything haha its alright i guess i wouldnt call it the time of my life 
ahahhaa whats wrong with it 
its just like really hard and no fun and the only people i talk to are irina and woojong 
that sucks what are you going to do 
i have no idea i cant tell if i hate it cause its hard or i hate it cause i dont like science 
that really sucks how much studying is it 
i would say 60 of my free time is trying to study 30 is thinking i should be studing and 10 is actually studying 
haha how are tge classes going 
some are better than others but theyre pretty decent biology is deathly boring though as usual but basically if you dont study enough outside of class you wont be able to understand future lectures lol the people in front of me are creeping megan and im pretty sure theyre bitching about her 
haha wouldnt be surprised that sucks that its boring though skype with me and richard 
ah shit i was in bed before i got this tonight 
tomorrow night 
as in tonight ya sure hey you wanna skype tonight 
cant 2nite working on essay 
lol nice good luck with that hey what seminar did you get for app history by the way guess who just accepted my friend request httpswwwfacebookcommatteozanellanotiftfriendconfirmed 
haha he declined me and i am not in apwh because it didnt fint my schedule 
oh my god i guess we all know who the favourite was now wow i didnt know what was conflicting 
i dont i think it was my app physics 
haha yeah probz not 
maybe my math or sum shit now i just have poli sci 
lol so are you disappointed 
not really haha 
haha yeah you probably didnt miss much do you think i should go to nbm 
its up to you i dont know if the board will pay for you to go though 
lol i doubt it i think im going to run for the eh team but im not sure yett 
you should maybe you could get a ride up with who ever is going up are you going to the meeting tomorrow 
yea ill have to see i have a midterm tomorrow but i might go anyways are you going 
not i have a physics test tomorrow 
lol good excuse do you think its worth it for me to go 
if i were u i wouldnt 
haha okay maybe i wont then 
aha what midterm do you have 
bio and i have chem on friday bio is the worst class everr 
haha what makes it bad is it the prof 
yeah the prof is superr boring and she always gives unnecessary information and the content is really dull to start with 
shitty do you think u are gonna change you are classes for after christmas 
i havent decided yet its kind of a tricky situation haha 
yea where would you want to switch to 
well i think i want to do psychology but for that you have to choose either a ba or bsc so its really a matter of if its worth it to swtich into arts 
do you want to be in arts 
i dont really know ive always sort of ruled it out without consideration but lately ive been considering it cause id do anything but science right now i just dont really like the idea of getting an arts degree i guess 
what about buzz bizz 
hm maybe not sure cause i really like psychology but i dont really want to do science or an arts degree so im screwed hahabut i should probably look into the degree program a bit more cause i think for the bsc theres not as much science after the first year 
hm it sucks that you dont like the shit you are doing 
yeah its pretty depressing actuallybut its funny cause like during the week it doesnt fee too bad cause youre all wrapped up in everything but when it comes to the weekend i just have like no modivation to do things cause i just think about how not interested i am in everything 
how are you doing in your classes 
its really mixed i have like a 96 in my bio lab and then like a c in the bio class and a b in physics and chem about 
thats still pretty good though isnt it 
yeah it alright in university the percentages are different letter grades though sometimes 60 is a c lol i heard you got best actor congratz 
lollol thanks im a star tcamp just accepted my friend request ffrum 2 months ago 
lol oh my god and all this time we thought he hated u 
that was the best thing that happened to me this year 
haha well i mean its a pretty hard thing to top someone got grad photos httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid10201483398579639seta1559681064726741101016262677type1theater 
oh good god 
more like oh good god bless america 
haha i am really weirder out by max now i wonder what he is like now 
lol yeah i know i dont know if i would meet up with him cause it would be super awkard but im so curious by the way whats the deal with this whole legging scandal 
someone just said that they were banning them but they werent 
lol what an fhs classic so zach hall tarra joshi and mercedes are running against me for dcc 
are you going up 
no im just sending a video i hope it doesnt hurt my chances but tarras already had the position and mercedes in also running for njr so im hoping that will help my chances 
what do you think your odds are 
i have no idea but i really hope i get it i havent read the others applications yet 
who else is applying for what 
its mercedes and some random for njr sierra for ncc francois and mitch for ecc and harley for icc 
so dcc is the hardest 
yeah pretty much but there are two spots open 
oh really that ups you are chances a lot do u know if zach is going to nbm 
no i dont but i bet he is pretty sure mercedes is going and not sure about tarra but i bet she is too cause shes on eh team 
she lives in toronto now so probabily 
mercedes or tarra 
tarra but i saw that mercedes is going 
okay yeah i think mercedes is at mcgill 
ya 
so many people seem to be at mcgill 
i know and everyone i have asked this year said they are applying 
haha pretty ambitious do you think youll want to go there 
yea there or u of t or waterloo but my number 1 is mcgill 
wow cool have you decided what you want to do yet 
ya i going to do art science computer science and economics 
cool yeah that sounds good i think im gonna transfer schools next year 
really where do u think youll go 
yeah im thinking either ottawau or dalhousie but i cant decide 
are you u going to stick with science 
i havent really decided yet but i think i will and do a bsc in psychology i dunno ive just decided to stop thinking about it for a while haha 
how are you are classes going 
okay i guess not great but im getting by i should probably apply myself more than i am 
do u think you will be able to transfer in to uottawa or dalhousie with you are marks now 
i dont really know i thought about that im not sure what the policy is on transferring and marks but probably especially if i pick it up next term worst case scenario ill have to retake some classes when i get there 
yea whats the rational for the transfer just want to get out of fredericton 
yeah i just kinda realized that all my friends in fredericton are leaving for university next year except for woojong and i want to meet new people cause i really havent met anyone at unb worth staying for are you reading this post in the junior board group 
yea u should offer to go 
do you think so i would feel awkward since i havent been around does it cost anything for me 
i have no clue 
okay should i ask then 
yea because as is we arent sending anyone 
okay done i hope they reply soon oh my god i found your dad on google maps 
haahahahahahahah typical bob 
haha good old reliable i like that hes wearing rubber boots to rake the lawn 
thats his work outft for all seasons 
haha what a classy guy did you go to the minicamp 
haha no lol 
haha so you dont go to meeting then either 
haha no 
lol even so i think were still not the worst past chairs 
ahhahahha impossible travis and sam or kevin 
haha for sure ill have to tell you about the whole nbm thing later 
httpthebrunscabreakingaunbtsetsstrikedeadline you are dad is in this 
lol yeah hes the chair of the collective bargaining coucil ive gotten the inside scoop the whole time haha 
how does an email leak haha 
lol i dont even know maybe they did it on purpose haha ill have to ask my dad tomorrow 
how long do you think the strike will last 
well my dad said that the average strike length is 17 days but they have no idea its basically all on the administration and how long they drag their asses on this 
so what does it mean for the students will you just finish later 
we dont really know yet but the most plausible thing is well probably lose our march break and maybe finish a bit later lol my dad said the administration leaked the email 
aha why 
who knows my dad wasnt mad or anything maybe they think theyre exposing them or something but they were about to tell everyone anyways so its not like a secret or anything 
haha so the strike is going to happen 
yeah pretty much my dad said it will unless a miracle happens the administration are being assholes though so im pretty sure theyll be a strike 
hey mia long time no talk 
haha yeah hey whats up 
nm junior board news max and alicia were empeached at the last junior board meeting 
what the fuck are you serious 
haha yeah my mom told me this morning its crazyy 
oh my god haha why did they get kicked out did the adults do it 
the junior board did it 
whoa so do you know why 
because they didnt go to the meetings 
haha wow we are approaching rock bottom i think what did you are mom say 
just layed down the facts ye this is rock bottom 
i feel kinda bad that we ditched them but at the same time its so freeing that there really was no other option 
i just was not interested this year 
yeah same like i ran for that position for national but if i got it what would i even say about our chapter like i feel like theres literally nothing left we can do it was just too frustrating 
yea yea i dont know i think we did our job mqx and alicia are lacking 
yeah i think we did all can do like i see max and ill ask him about cisv and hell like just shut it out and never want to talk about it 
hm dave and justice are coming up as chair 
i hope theyre okay what does david think 
hasnt said anything but i think he is nervous 
yeah probably he was kinda pushed into it in the first place oh my god httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvlt0yj9obo3k speak of the devil 
haha it gave me an error 
just put in the search cisv fredericton introduction video oh my god and then the juxtaposition of this httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvwcuucmdvo0 
haha i am suprised that people are showing up watching that video made me a little nostalgic 
yeah i know haha i was surprised liam chase was there yeah same it almost makes me feel bad for dropping off the map but then i just remember how frustrating it was 
haha i feel ya how school going 
haha its pretty bad right now since theyre trying to get a bunch of stuff in before march break since theyre not allowed to make things due that week haha hows the old fhs 
same shit different day ready to be done what are you are plans for next year 
haha classic yeah i think im gonna apply for uottawa and dal but ill probabily go to ottawa you 
probabily mcgill i dont know how was mcing ccnb new years 
haha yeah i hate thinking about university lol it was pretty chill oh my god but you should have seen some of the graphics they put up 
hhah where they weak who does them 
lol they were so bad it was funny its like they just google image searched shit and put it in a slideshow while the dances were going 
haha how was mcing with rich 
lol it was decent we kept it classy but you should have heard how cheesy the others mcs jokes were hows richie these days 
i can only imagine frank is a riot rich is still a cock only talks to me when he wants something from me 
haha oh my god do i have a story about that 
ahhaham dish the dirt 
okay its kinda long of and the obligatory dont tell richie oh oh but before i tell i should tell you that he told me a while ago that all his friends in high school were like not hanging out with him because you guys all have significant others of something haha and i was like thinking maybe theyre all just annoyed with you 
haha yea its funny that he said that aha 
haha yeah okay so anyways a while back i was talking to irina about how i was annoyed with richard and like how hes like different then he used to be and stuff cause we always sorta bitch about him not doing youth group stuff together so like a couple weeks after hes been wanting to skype me and i was getting out of it cause i really dont need to listen to his girl problems for 3 hours but then he messages me and is like can we schedule something so i know i have to say yes and i just know its gonna be about what irina said cause i guess shes a backstabber apparently lol oh and before all this i was like super monotone and unresponsive to him when we talked and he didnt even notice but anyways so he just straight up asked me like ive heard some things and i was like oh shit and then we was like someone said that you think ive changed and so at first i tried to kinda like save myself and cover it up but then eventually it just became this huge monologue for me highlighting all the things that id been annoyed at him with but i know he doesnt really listen to people when theyre talking so i kept asking him comprehension question throughout and he couldnt answer any of them if was seriously so perplexing and then somehow we got on a tangent about tess and in that tangent he literally proceeded to do pretty much all the things that i just told him were bad anyways long story short it looks like hes not gonna change any time soon 
haha he told me about that call haha for like a day he acted like he was worried about it but then he stopped and hasnt brought it up since 
haha yeah that seems about right like i said all these things and i asked him what he got out of the call and all he said was uh sometimes when i think im right im not 
i liked neurotic richard way more than douche richard 
haha same oh and that same day we had this huge debate about how like he cant use girls to solve all his problems cause i said that you cant rely on others for you own happiness and thats not what being in a relationship is about and he like flat out didnt believe me 
haha i dont think he gets that its not okay to use people 
haha thats the best description though actually 
i wonder what tess thinks of him 
lol who knows me and woojong were talking the other day and theres a pretty good chance shes a sociopath haha 
haha thats exactly what i said to him and he blows it off she seems like a crazy 
haha classic richie but yeah i went through all the symptoms with we and its at least borderline 
she jerked him around alooot but at least it was to himmm 
lol yeah did you hear about yoon 
i heard what richard said 
haha yeah ive never heard of anyone who treated their bf that shitty 
richard sells it like it was all yoons fault 
lol its totally not 
what happened thenn 
apparently like they never said anything about their relationship when yoon went away so he assumed they were still going out and would like txt her everyday even though it was inconvinient for him and then meanwhile in freddy she was saying things like im glad im single all while she was still getting texts from him and then he like visited freddy over christmas just to see her cause his parents arent even here anymore and she still didnt say anything and then like he showed up to richards party and she was like caught red handed hanging with richard and thats how it ended 
haha fucking richard he was telling me that yoon didnt want to go out with her anymore and it was a mutual split 
lol who knows cause im hearing it pretty down the line but i really doubt it happened like how richard said 
i think he likes to bend facts to make a point 
oh yeah definitely when i gave him advice i would like always ask him to see things from the other persons perspective and hes actually incapable of doing so 
haha i no and he always claimed to be so good at it 
lol yeah i know to be honest im starting to think hes a crazy 
i no it kinda sucks because me and him use to be best friends but now he only talks to me when he wants weed and he blames it on the fact that i am dating rachel and one time he gave me shit for spending so much time with her but its like i dont even spend thaaaat much time with her but yea she is my girlfriend look at how much time u spend with tess a girl you are not even dating he didnt like it when i said that 
like who says that shit why does he even care if youre spending too much time with rachel when all he wants from you is weed hes clearly just using that as an excuse to justify his guilt 
yea all of the dudes kinda feel the same way he is just kinda a bad guy now 
yeah and it kinda crept up on me we used to be super close and then all of a sudden it seemed like all he did was talk about himself 
yea he use to not be like that i think he always claimed that shad made him a better person but i thinkk it made him worse 
haha its almost like that fact that it gave him confidence was a bad thing its like he thinks that like if he has all those goodguyonpaper things that it will make him a good guy 
yeah but is really just doesnt work i dont even know who he is friends with now daniel he and thats it 
lol and tess i guess 
yea i guess i dont know i think he is just a friend collector now 
yeah thats totally his thing cause hes always talking about how he loves talking to people to hear all their secrets we told me he got daniel he into weed too 
haha well daniel he got him self into weed but they are both so dumb about it 
haha yeah apparently richard does it cause he gets super stressed about tess or something 
yea thats a really good idea richard use drugs to releave stress and dampen emotion that has never turned out bad for anyone oh wait he is a fucking idiot 
haha i just hope he doesnt take it too far 
knowing him he will anyways im going to hit the hay gn 
lol oh my god samezies talk to you later one step closer to world domination 
ahhahahahahhahahhahahahahhaha well hes right about the not being photogenic part 
lol yeah thats for sure

she posted an album today on facebook of a photoshoot she did so weird 
oh yeah haha who was the photographer 
james smokey caverhill 
oh my god is one of the pictures her cover photo 
ahhahahahah yea tip of the ice berg 
actually burst out laughing seriously i wanna see more now 
haha oh shit i think she took down the album i have it open but when i click on a picture it says content unavible 
whoa did she like just put it up i wonder if people made fun of it 
she posted it sometime earlier today but it was suuuuuper suggestive as in butt picz haha 
ah thats so awkward like why maybe her parents made her take it down lol 
haha i really hope they saw it haha but the whole album she looks extremely uncomfortable 
haha really i bet its cause the photographer had his shutter shades on 
aahahahaha yea i saw that picture of him i would love to walk by this shoot in odell 
haha yeah seriously ive seen bad photoshoots before but thats one of the worst ive seen and that was just one picture 
haha she is a body builder too 
lol yeah ive heard its funny cause she seemed super weird in class like shed sit right up front and try to be best friends with the teachers once i was sitting behind these people that were like bitching about her and stuff 
ahhaah she dated travis 
lol yeah i remember hearing of it but i never witnessed it didnt she like do cisv for a while 
she came to a minicamp once or twice she seemed like a rel idiot 
yeah she has a bit of crazy eyes going she and travis should have stayed together to be honest 
once i brought her up to trav daddy and he was like oh god dont remind me of her if travis dislikes her how bad is she 
haha yeah seriously i didnt have too many interactions with her but she was like the only one that would volunteer for class demonstrations her and jacqueline cleland 
haha who is that 
lol shes just this girl in my grade whos known for being weird she like dressed up for holidays and stuff and got most school spirit 
haha oh shit that girl whats her deal 
lol her moms basically crazy i knew her in grade 6 and her mom would make her go to bed at like 7 
haha sounds well adjusted to me whe are you going up to dal 
haha my last day of work is next friday and then im actually going to new york for a few days to meet up with some people from my seminar camp then im flying home and driving up on the 31st haha what about you 
haha i go up the 23rd its stupidly early 
lol thats weird how long does your orientation last 
like a week but there is time inbetween move in day and orientation 
oh okay that doesnt really make much sense though haha to be honest not really looking forward to orientation 
same here haha its just one big party and i dont think thats my scene because you are 19 do u think people are gonna be asking you to buy them liquor 
ya same oh god i hope not but probably im planning on putting off telling my age as much as possible haha im also not looking forward to all the icebreaker activities 
haha yea well youll be a pro because of cisv 
lol yeah im sure the blanket game will be a hit with college kids 
aahahaha bring it out on you are first day there 
haha ill be so popular maybe ill even get the chance to run some activities oh my god kristen mcfawn so copied you are profile picture haha 
haha what can i say the boys want me the ladies want to be me 
haha 
look at it on facebook 
oh my god its his cover photo do you get the caption 
not at allllll i think its an attempt at a joke 
yeah its hard to say exactly cause it also comes off as a passive agressive remark kind of 
haha yeah i felt weirdly condescend to tonight i saw papa probert at the airport 
haha speak of the devil who were you dropping off at the airport 
picking up old dave he was on a step up from the uk in 
oh yeah haha did he have a good time who else was in his delegation httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid804099866300798setmscejw1x8enacamascndcjpyf3bfnebvd4aqugobhq9de8e99u4y1wlnvqcswgxhqy3bpst1016262677type1theater

lol oh yeah does he have any good stories 
haha not really just that there were some competitive arabs haha whats the picture of 
lol nice its a picture from max from village ill try and get it for you but i bet if you went to his profile you could guess which one it is 
is it the balls one 
lol yup nice 
some people never change 
lol oh definitely i wonder what it would be like to meet him again 
haha he is studying materials engineering in west virginia i think he seems kinda normal except i think he is super republican 
lol yeah the whole republican thing makes me more skeptical of him to be honest i never thought id ever know like a real republican lol 
haha do u no carol davis 
what is she a republican 
haha no i got matched with her on tinder haha 
haha oh okay was confused there for a sec yeah i kinda know her shes pretty chill 
i also got matched with cait gautron haha 
lol thats hilarious do you see a lot of people you know on it 
haha like a few here and there i also got matched with rian smith but i think she deleted her tinder or deleted me o 
haha too good i want to know who like has it and takes it seriously 
haha make an accout lol i wonder what guys have it 
haha im curious too but im scared to make an account lol 
haha its pretty low risk low reward too prob a lot of creepy guys tho 
haha lol yeah i bet good old jeff probert is on there has anyone ever messaged you on it 
haha yea its pretty common infact cait messaged me but i only responed once 
haha it must be so awkward i wonder if anyone ends up meeting from it 
haha id hope not but people def do its just awkward when you are matched with some1 u kinda know 
lol ya i bet thats so fredericton too haha seeing someone you kinda know but you havent met and you have to pretend that you dont know who each other is when you do 
haha i always feel like that then i think to myself maybe the person actually doesnt know me 
lol yeah same or like sometimes the person will act like they know me and i have no idea who they are then i wonder like where were you where people were talking about me haha 
haha thats really true i always wonder what people say about me yhat dont know me 
i know same every once and a while ill find out something and i always remember it for some reason 
haha what do u mean 
like if my friend tells me what someone i dont really know thinks of me i tend to remember it haha 
haha yeah i always find that wierd like how did that person go about forming an opinion about me if i dont know them why were you in ryan tapleys living room april 18th 
haha i knew youd ask that he was having like a going away party and i was invited haha was pretty surprised to be on the list really 
how was the party it looked showie 
it was pretty i interesting it was like mostly his family there and then there was like 8 friends there and we just like chilled on our own i was like the only person there that wasnt in theatre it was pretty awkward i had to stick with matt leblanc and connie haha mrs mcallister was there for a bit too haha 
haha what the fuck mrs mcallister showed up my invite must have been lost in the mail also do u know this face 
haha yeah we were all wondering where you were lol yeah mrs mcallister was really nice about it too apparently shes been to the gertlers for dinner too lol is that the famous junior councillpr ryan ross

yeah i know i was like okkkkkk haha 
haha it was posted pre village i wish it was shared with us at village 
lol yeah so deep but like the guy who wrote that was the same guy who went to village with us haha 
agaga and i liked ryan i am second guessing my judgment from when i was 11

ahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahaahha what does the mailbox mean 
thats the mystery i guess haha ive seen mary ellen nealis photography a few times now 
the photography scene in freddy is strong the one who took photos of monica serano is the most talented tho 
httpsscontentaxxfbcdnnethphotosxaf1vt10955041510151482659693065786209448njpgoh152e1f182dc140aacea82ac331d526efoe5497c1ed lol ya for sure wish i got my grad photos from that guy 
haha that photo of mcalister is too good i need to make it my cover photo 
lol if only you could 
have u started clases yet 
yeah i started on thursday you 
yeah i started tuesday how are they so far 
pretty good stats is a joke discrete math is hell all the others are pretty decent intro to theatre is super pretentious though haha 
oh im in discrete math too 
haha oh my god cool how are you liking it 
its prob my hardest class we are doing logic stuff like subsets logic rules and testing statments what are u doing 
yeah were doing stuff like that too boolean fuctions and truth tables its definitely my hardest class too 
haha truth tables make it a lot easier i have had that class 4 times and three out of 4 of those classes the prof has worn the exact same shirt and shorts 
haha thats great my prof has an earring and always wears his button ups with one button that should probably be done up haha i dont really have a feel for the class yet but im a bit worried cause its also crosslisted as a computer science class so hell be talking about codes as like an example and ill have no idea whats going on haha 
haha has he done that yet 
yeah hell he like just like in java when and ill be like what 
was the course mandatory 
no im actually just taking it as an elective haha but i think i need a 2000 level science course is yours mandatory 
is it consider a science class there 
yeah pretty sure cause math is under the science faculty but i think its also considered a computer science course 
oh wow its just a math class here 
yeah you guys might have math as a faculty i dont know what are your other classes like 
i have linear algebra micro economics stats in economics and foundations of programming what about you 
i have discrete math intro to stats methods in experimental psych intro to cognitive psych and intro to theatre what are the ones you have wchris 
the two econ ones he is 2 dumb 4 the others haha how big is the intro to theatre class 
haha nice its apparently like 110 people but it feels small its a required course for the theatre majors but i have no idea what the percentage of them in the class is cause it also satisfies writing requirements for all majors 
httpsfbcdnsphotosgaakamaihdnethphotosakxpa1vt109168681101504077966753017456308njpgoh233a2aefc9965006818e5e687fe93687oe54952e9fgda14182465150d6dc468b8a220be8330a07fa11b0213 i just found the best thing in the world 
ah oh my god she talked about that relationship for way longer after it happened than she should have haha this guy first person to comment is alex landines mom 
abhahhahahahahahahahahahagahahaha who is john jang 
hes like this classic from my grade he was in me mardi gras haha hes super awkward oh my god richards relationship status 
shit i assumed that you knew haha its been like that for 2 or 3 weeks 
lol no way i havent talked to him in like months someone told me it was up like a couple weeks ago but he took it down or something haha 
haha yeah i feel extremely uneasy about that relationship 
lol yeah same i feel like it cant end well do you know how they finally ended up together 
haha basically he just asked haha 
haha didnt he already ask her i wonder what changed 
haha i guess its because they are apart i have no clue honestly i think richard is under her control also i think tess is a lesbian but thats just a theory 
haha oh yeah he totally is woojong used to tell me about how she totally tool over his life lol what makes you think that 
aahha any woman who doesnt want to sleep with richard has to be a lesbian 
haha 
haha i dont know i was listening to a podcast and this girl was talking about being a lesbian and not knowing she was and how she would get really close with guys and then kinda shut down it just reminded me of that i dont know just a theory haha 
lol interesting personally my theory is shes a sociopath 
haha she isnt mean enough 
im not so sure cause glen gong told her he liked her and she avoided giving him a straight answer all while getting drives home from school with him everyday but thats a bit of a stretch interpretation ill admit 
haha used i fear 4 richard shell dump him and he will literally go crazy 
yeah seriously to be honest im kinda glad i wont have to be there to pick up the pieces 
haha do u know mr wilson 
lol yeah ive heard of him 
interm from you are senior year intern for dunnny boy 
yeah i remember him people have him on facebook 
dunfield haha yes 
lol 
look what he commented on their relationship status so awkward 
haahhaha yeah i saw it 
haha so fucking funny 
tell me about it he always comments awkward shit like that lol yes its always hilarious too i wonder if teachers always put kids in class together 
haha thats so weird then agian i ship teacher 247 
lol yeah for sure once i asked mme lasalle if teachers bitch about students together and she was like yeah but later kinda retracted it 
haha i was def resented by a lot of teachers 
haha did you troll a lot 
haha i was generally speaking a shit for most of my time at fhs haha 
lol nice yeah they probably got tired of your shit then 
haha def how are you liking discrete math 
ive actually been finding it really interesting weve kinda started this new section that seems fun 
yeah me to its hard but cool did u start number theory 
i think were doing that soon 
what did u start 
we just finished predicate pogic logic yeah were on to counting now 
do u know how to prove p xnor qp iff q i have an assignment and cant get the awnser answer 
haha one sec can you snap me a picture of the question 
kk 
im almost thinking if i really like the course i might double major in it actually 
what would the major be question c 
psych and math k lemme see what i can do haha 
oh yea that would be cool 
yeah i kinda want to but its weird cause they sort of expect you to do honors in psych here and i dont think i would have time to do honors and another degree im just not sure what rules would allow for the rearrangement 
yeah i got that but i have to name each steps rule i think 
for rearranging it yeah probably 
that helps i didnt write the rhs like that but it makes more sense thanks hows the intro to theatre class going 
yeah no probabily also try negating the left side and use the conditional equivalent and then its contrapositive and see if that get you anyhwere anywhere theatre is good i didnt realize how unarts i was until i started the class haha 
haha un arts do you find it hard 
not in class but its hard writing an essay for a text you have nothing to say on haha 
haha is it a long essay 
its 750 words so not really but i havent written an essay in over a year so its a struggle lol plus all the essay i wrote in high school were bull shit anyways 
haha is it about a play 
yeah its like this obscure canadian play thats basically about nothing 
haha do you act it out in class or just read it you are self 
you just read it and then there was a bit of discussion and the prof goes over some themes so glad i dont have to act haha 
haha i pictured the class taking place in a theatre 
no its just in a lecture room haha its still a pretty intimidating class though cause most of the people in it are theatre majors so i feel out of place haha richards song httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvqsvybhjrnqw 
ahahahhahahahah im dumb she a lesbian 
haha yeah or let me know the truth too accurate 
haha 
oh my god i 
will and t camp 
yes i just saw that 
and bernard lord haha its really funny i wonder how tommy camp found it 
is it an article 
yeah from 2003 
lol what the fuck i bet thats like all he does with his day is find clever archived articles 
haha i am still hoping to see himm 
yes ive been waiting for an update 
ill track him down so how was that frat party last night 
haha we left early but after me and my friend left some serious shit went down after 
what happened 
httpwwwcbccamnewscanadanovascotiadeckcollapseinsouthendhalifaxsends6tohospital12779841 
holy fuck thats crazy 
i knowww right and some of the people were from our res 
oh shit how are they 
this guy on my floor was there and he said there was blood everywhere 
ah 
they were okay but one of the guys broke his femur and fractured his hip he had surgery this morning its fucked up 
shit that sucks at least no one died i guess the deck looked really high up 
yeah i know it was like 3 stories or something one of the guys in know was on it but he was okay so i guess the injuries vary 
on the top deck 
yeah i think he might have gotten back in the house before it was too late but im not sure ill have to ask him later haha 
thats fucked i guess its good u left early how was the party while u were there 
yeah i guess i almost wish i was there cause i was pretty sober though lol it was actually not that bad a ton of people from my res were there so i just chilled with them it was a pretty nice house this jewish guy from our res wants to pledge haha 
haha is it a jewish frat 
lol yeah that was the best part they even drew a star of david on our hand as a stamp haha 
haha classic frats are weird i know like 5 people in my res who are pledging i have no idea why they are doing it 
yeah that was my first experience with the frats and i have to say im not too impressed have you been to a frat party yet 
haha no frats here are weird its too expensive to buy a house in the city so there are fraternities but they dont have an actual building its like a social club 
haha thats so lame like why would you ever join that 
haha i know i think it is a bro thing the res im in is super bro heavy 
haha really are you like friends with them or are you in like an alternative group 
haha yea the alt group some of the bros are pretty cool guys but a lot of people love clubbing and shit 
haha oh yeah everyones legal there are you into clubbing haha 
haha i have gone a few times it can be half way decent if im drunk enough i wouldnt dare going sober its always just really funny to watch how people act in the club 
haha yeah clubbing is only fun if youre drunk what are your friends like 
a lot of them i met from smoking weed they are mostly in arts and another group i met through frosh and they are all in science i have a kinda shitty floor in terms of how many bros there are tho haha what about you 
haha do you like them my friends are pretty chill theyre actually mostly from my floor me and my roommate are pretty much best friends haha i feel lucky cause my floors really chill like we have no bros its like half internationals haha 
haha my res is like bro res and my floor has like extra bros but there are a couple cool people on my floor 
haha that kinda sucks how many people are on your floor how excluded do you feel from this haha httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid10153189473643275seta10150276521828275403995560833274type1theater 
haha that bitch rachel ruining my life 
haha did you even know he was there 
whoops haha yeah i hung out with him and shit i didnt want to go with them that day because she was there haha 
aw that sucks do you ever see those guys around campus 
oh yeah like i still hang with josh and jack the class no problem prove the following problem is in npsubset sum problem given a set of n integers x1 x2 xn is there asubset of these numbers that sum to exactly k have you seen this problem in discrete math i am stuck 
sorry no idea we havent learned that stuff yet 
its okay i have been looking for an answer on the internet and cant find one 
nice theres always a chance itll be out there haha 
i searched for 2 hours and couldnt find anything the class is really hard noww 
aw shit that sucks mine kinda got easier haha we just finished combinations and permutations 
what text are u using 
were using online texts ones called book of proof and the other is like lectures or something book of proof is the main one you 
discrete mathematicselementary and beyond we also use book of proof too though 
cool so what are you guys learning right now 
modulation and strange numbers i cant tell if the stuff we are doing is hard or if my prof just cant teach 
haha does he just make it seem harder than it is or something 
i think he might the concepts are generally easy enough to follow its just that the proofs are all really long and confusing 
that sucks my prof is pretty easy to follow so do you end up googling a lot of stuff then 
yeah i generally have to i am worried for the midterm how did your theater paper turn out 
yeah im kinda freaking out cause my midterm is tomorrow haha i got a b which is pretty much what i expected lol 
were u happy with a b 
i am for the first essay cause then i can go up from there haha plus it was over a year since i had written anything so ill aim higher next time hey do you need any brazilian bills 
haha i have brazil already are u going to another frat party tonight 
lol no way man its yom kippur no jewish frats tonight do you want money from bermuda 
ahahahhaahahahha are there a lot of jewish people there and also surprisingly have bermuda 
no not really ive only met like 2 jewish people hahawow how did you get that httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmjrtf1cbx0listtl0po6qzbcnifghpvpjzhqrjir6sxuvgks he makes his own radio show too 
haha where did u find this 
i forget i think someone recommended it to me when you get some time you should listen to his radio show 
what is it like 
its just like him answering questions 
haha sounds weird have u been listening to this american life 
oh yeah but i havent listened to the serial podcast yet have you 
yea serial is so goood 
yeah i knew it would be ive just been waiting for the right time to start it can you get on itunes lol mrs christmas followed me on instagram 
haha whats her instagram 
alexischristmas haha she like got it today and already posted like 5 pictures haha 
haha she is in montreal i should visit her 
haha you should use social media to find out where she is and just run into her 
haha i am considering it haha on of the photos she posted was at a place where u have to walk past my res to get there haha 
oh my god you should totally do it at least get a creepshot lol by the way serial is so good 
yea i love it have you listened to all of them 
yeah all of them so far i just want the next one to come out haha 
haha yes ive listened to each episode twice i cant get over how good they are 
haha yeah i was going to i just hope the ending is as good as the buildup is 
haha yeah i mean i doubt they will solve it but i mean maybe well they may solve it but i doubt the guy will get out of jail or maybe he did it 
yeah i dont think hell get out either whats your theory so far 
i think it was the guy who said adnan did it in the first episode 
yeah thats what i was gonna say 
like why would he say adnan did it for no reason 
yeah its weird that the police just never picked up on that like did they never think that he made it up 
haha it hasnt really been brought up on the show 
maybe theyll bring it up later theres definitely more to say on that guy 
yeah it would ruin the series if they never brought it up again 
yeah especially since everyone is getting their theories together whats the next episode about again 
httpsscontentaordxxfbcdnnethphotosxpf1vt10915604347712751262453145076037652767191092njpgohbcc3693a36e23576c3323fa5408279adoe54efdff0 
haha yeah i saw that good old connie have you started proofs yet 
yeah we have been doing them all along they suck 
theyre so hard i dont think ive completed one without help yet haha 
haha yeah its like i see how the prof did it but i would never have thought of that my self 
yeah i have no idea how im gonna do the assignments i bearly understand it when the prof does it and the notes dont really help 
what do you have to prove 
just like number theorems and stuff with gcd and lcm is that what youre doing 
we just finished that now we are doing combinatricks 
whats that like 
combinatorics 
haha 
weird so far but doesnt seem so bad all the number theory stuff is easy without proofs i find but the proofs are stupidly harrd 
yeah i agree and my prof like only taught it with respect to proofs so i still dont really get it i feel like im supposed to already know stuff that i dont jaha 
haha yeah if your class is anything like mine 90 of the people are comp sci 3rd years and a lot of the topics are review from previous courses 
yeah pretty much haha so why are you taking it in first yeah then year 
agaga i basically didnt know any better 
lol nice do you even have the prerequisites 
for the class or ingeneral 
for the class 
no but linear algebra is a coreq did you have any 
yeah i think we needed first year calculus maybe im wrong though cause it doesnt really make any sense i have to take linear algebra at some point though too 
haha its pretty rough it is just really boring discrete math is way more interesting 
damn its always either hard or boring haha do you have to take calculus at all 
yeah i have to take three calcs im doing those along with a couple other math classes over the next 4 semesters do you still want to minor in math 
yeah i did but lately im having second thoughts haha but i only need to take like 4 more classes to get it wondering if its worth it 
what are the other classes you would have to take 
linear algebra intermediate calculus 1 differential equations and another class of my choice the basics pretty much 
do you know what you are going to pick 
not yet but if u dont get into some psych classes ive wait listed for then ill take problems in geometry cause its literally the only course that fits in my schedule that goes towards my degree haha i dont really want to take it though cause the course description sounds lame haha 
haha 
theres a game theory class that looks cool but it would be so hard i bet 
yeah game theory looks really fun but really hard i want to do it 4th year 
yeah ive always been interested in it but i dont know if i could actually do problems on it 
haha yeah i mean maybe its one of those things that sound hard but is easy but its probably just hard 
lol yeah i mean wasnt it only discovered in like the 60s or something 
yeah there is a movie called a beautiful mind staring russel crow about john nash the guy who discovered it 
yeah thats what i was going off haha 
haha have u seen it 
lol yeah it wasnt bad actually at least from what i remember of it 
haha yeah im guessing they got the schizophrenia thing wrong but it was a pretty good story 
yeah i think he had it but i doubt it was that dramatic haha 
haha i mean like the symptoms he had were not like what people with schizophrenia go through at least i dont think is schizophrenia when u hear things or see things 
its like when you have hallucinations and it usually comes with some paranoia you can hear or see things and i guess smell things haha firstyearpsych 
smell things wow thats so strange 
pretty sure might be bull shit one sec ill google it yup apparently its possible rare though i bet 
wow are you finding dal any harder then unb 
not really it like balances out like the classes are easier cause i like them more but its also harder cause its second year are your classes hard 
i dont really have anythng to compare it to this semester im in 2 first year classes and 3 upper year classes they are all kinda hard 
wow did you have a guideline for how to pick your classes im surprised youre in so many upper year classes 
honestly i think there is a bug in the system because im in art sci the computer let me pick what want but first year students in arts cant take the econs im in 
haha just flying under the radar just make sure you get all the degree requirements and you should be fine 
haha i dont think ill get a degrreee either way 
lol what do you mean 
haha i was jking i am def getting a degree 
lol yeah are you gonna be able to get a double major in 4 years 
yeah its do able but all my classes have to be towards a major 
do you mind or did you want to take electives 
its not bad so far but there are some cool classes i am prob missing out on 
yeah im glad i have an arts requirements so i can take some cool stuff 
yea hows the theater class going 
haha its not too bad i just hate all the essay writing so glad i didnt go into arts to be honest 
yeah i am trying my best to stay on the maths side of econ essay grading is kinda bull shit 
do you have to write a lot of essays 
i havent had to yet i hope it keeps that way although writing essays can be fun 
haha so much fun what are your econ classes like are they interesting 
one is econ stats so its basically a math class the other has great material but the prof is really bad my brother says she is the worst prof hes ever had 
haha what makes him so bad httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv5ofvemak64 
haha that must have taken so long to edit 
lol yeah i love that theyre like in the canadian tire parking lot for half of it oh my god this too httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvipn604d62s 
haha that movie was so fucking weird 
yeah i know its like a whole other side of fredericton so many charles leblanc clips haha 
i wonder how much charles leblancs media empire is worth 
haha wasnt he like homeless at one point 
haha yeah i think he was he seems pretty off the wall 
lol yeah maxs mom is friends with him actually haha 
speaking of max did u see their 48 hour film 
no not yet is it up on youtube 
httpvimeocom110073587 
ill watch it once i get off mobile ive been wanting to see it so bad haha did you like it 
haha it was pretty good i dont know good for 48 
haha you would know i guess have you seen any of the other ones 
i saw jacks little bros it was bad like cringe httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlq2hdwxx9e 
oh my god peters was so cringe haha 
haha i know the production quality was pre good have u ever considered making a short 
haha yeah i really want to some time but ive never even able to think of a good story i actually made one in middle school haha have you been listening to serial lately 
yeah have u 
haha yeah of corse do you have any theories yet 
i still think jay what about you 
i dont know today i started thinking that maybe adnan actually did it but jay would be my next guess 
eyah last episode made me think it was adnan 
yeah like they said if he didnt do it then who did like i cant really think of anyone else unless theres something we dont know 
yeah it just doesnt make sense why jay lied about all that shit 
yeah thats the biggest argument for me like he has no modivation to say anything unless he was actually involved 
yeah but even then why would he say he helped 
yeah like no one would lie about that 
maybe he did it and thought if he said he just helped he would be better off 
yeah this is true 
haha maybe jay is just crazy he lied haha have u been following the fhs thing dress code 
haha yeah well kinda ive just been reading the facebook stuff and i read the petition thing what did you think 
i agree with what they are saying but i dislike how they are going about it what about you 
yeah same pretty much i agree with what they are saying but i thought what they wrote was a bit sassy and not professional enough in some parts 
haha that video made me cringe 
they are being too radical for people in new brunswick to take them seriously i havent seen the video left yet whats it like 
its hard to describe the emotion they are trying to get across but it wasnt super well done 
yeah it feels like they just want to be radical more than they actually want to make a change 
haha yeah def its also kinda strange how many people are opposing it 
yeah sam peterson posted like a thing against it and like so many people agreed with it 
what she say 
she shared something that someone else said one sec 
she is such a bad writer i really just dislike both sides of this whole thing 
yeah i know haha you cant really win cause if they get rid of the dress code people are gonna troll so hard but also i feel like most people dont really care one way or the other 
haha yeah people are just indifferentwhen u heading back to fredericton 
like the 13th or something u 
17 or 18th i am pretty excited to go back 
yeah i bet im kinda glad i chose to go to halifax cause at least i can go home on long weekends ive already been back like twice 
httpsscontentbiadxxfbcdnnethphotosxpa1vt1091035317110155006855250473262243736166434960njpgoh5a89c92a817c1f4bb6d7aef0964f1656oe550c14b7 
ahahahhaa is that that guy from nbm 
oh no not white guy dreads those look horrible 
lol i know right they never look good like why 
i think that family is suppper religious but they were really nice while we were there 
i dont have any memory of them being religious at all do you all i remember is they were super awesome 
no it was only afterwards nice pp by the way 
lol thanks did you see maxs 
yeah and sams right 
lol yeah i was so pissed haha

yea it is 
have you seen many people yet 
yeah i have hung out with most of my friends already what about you 
yeah same just a couple people i need to see i went to the capital on sunday and so many people were there mrs mcallister was there and it was so weirddddd 
haha did she go to meet up with you and you are friends 
lol no her son was there i think she went with him 
oh haha did u chat her 
lol no i was too embarrassed haha 
dont blame u haha 
i wasnt even like drunk but i was still like ah teacher in a bar mr breen was there too 
haha old breen is the capital you are favourite bar in freddy 
lol well considering its the only bar ive been to in freddy id say ya but its pretty cool you just see like a lot of old hipsters 
haha ew old hipsters are so sad they seem like dead beats 
haha yeah i know its kinda like hipsters of all ages lol like theres a lot of people like alex matsons age that go or at were there the other night do you go to bars a lot in montreal 
ive been to a couple cool ones but people seem more interested in clubbing than going to bars haha 
lol yeah same so do you go to clubs a lot then 
aghaha no not really 
lol yeah me neither but mostly cause everyones 18 haha do people just drink in res for you then 
well there are a lot of rez parties where everyone stays in so i guess there is just a group of people who go clubbing non stop and i dont get it haha 
haha thats so lame thats like the group of people that always go to frat parties here like why and theyre always wanting me to go and dont understand why i dont want to 
agaha are frat parties like the thing to do at dal 
haha not really sure i just think all the first years go cause they cant go out lol plus like were closer to the frat parties in our res compared to the other reses are there house parties in montreal 
yeah ive been to a couple of appartment parties but they are always weird 
haha yeah i bet do you like always know the person hosting best christmas picture from my newsfeed so far 
i found a plaid one 2 haha 
haha that picture looks like its from the 80s 
haha there are so many ridiculous photos 
lol i know its hard to keep up with them did i show you the anneke latouche halloween one

ajhhh he looks 35 
lol yeah she has the greasiest bfs ever since justin lee haha 
haha she is weird my brother says she smells likr pee 
haha what the fuck thats messed up lol ella just confirmed apparently her whole house smells like that haha 
haha weird whats her deal 
shes like aggressively normal and loves winnie the pooh other than that i dont know haha she was always really nice to me but from facebook she feels off haha httpswwwfacebookcomhumansoffrederictonhighschool this is pure gold damn just found out its fake i dont know if that makes it better or worse 
haha i stumbled on that recently still ridiculous 
lol yeah i dont really know how i feel about it i guess its better than it being a real thing haha 
haha i remember a couple of them were pre funny 
lol yeah its kinda funny to see like whats up at fhs with all the younger kids haha guess who httpsscontentbxxfbcdnnethphotosxpa1vt10910906345102023918611965254480235362880066663njpgoh82c7e47f91e3e06346945c31870fd3cdoe55377b7c 
haha who is that 
jeff probert lol 
ahahhahahahhahaha did he post it on facebook 
yeah its his new prof picture 
haha how was you are time back in freddy 
it was okay nice seeing people but my dads been sick so that kinda sucked you 
oh sorry mine was good it seemed short weird being back and living w parents again 
yeah i felt the same way haha what was it like seeing your friends again 
its was good everyone was still normal so that was good but it was weird seeing people who didnt leave freddy thinking like they have been there the whole time what about you 
it was good ive been back already so ive pretty much seen everyone but i was with will on nye and it was awkward haha 
haha why 
we were hanging out at charlottes house and i guess he was drunk cause he like touched my leg on the couch and kept trying to sit closer and it was so awkward haha i just like got up and sat somewhere else lol 
haha ouf thats creepy has he adressed it yet 
me messaged me a couple days ago but i didnt make conversation haha his message was like friendly but im still creeped out lol 
haha when i hear shit like that i am so happy i am not a girl 
lol yeah i felt show shitty like is that all you care about haha what made it worse was like he was flirting kiana right before then after she left he like turned to me 
haha on to the next one was kiana also not having it 
lol she was like weirdly into it i think which is weird considering im pretty sure shes seeing someone haha 
haha who 
some guy named yassan he goes to unb i think theres a picture of him on her instagram 
oh yea well thats weird it has always seemed like kiana and will were into each other which beats me haha 
haha yeah i dont get it they were like cuddling and stuff 
that reallly weird what kind of party was this that must have seemed really out of the ordinary 
haha it wasnt really a party we were at the capital and just went back to charlottes to chill and sleep there was only like charlotte luke catherine craig kaiden me and kiana and will you definitely have to go to the capital when you turn 19 haha its so weird 
haha what is it like 
its like all the washed up hipsters in fredericton converging in one place haha i saw like so many older hipsters from high school 
haha that sounds so weird is it in the tannery 
is that the place next to jacks pizza 
yeah like where dolans and klub khrome is haha 
yeah thats where it is haha has your brother gone 
yeah acouple times he says its weird 
lol yeah it totally is especially going with ella theres like all tees creepy old dudes trying to get with her 
haha does she have a fake 
lol yup shes on her second one shes already been kicked out of the capital 
haha has she chilled out at all 
i think shes actually been better lately like since the summer anyways she finished school and she doesnt hang out with the younger hipsters that much anymore so shes doesnt drink as much shes still a pain to go out with though haha 
because she drinks so much 
yeah and shes like reckless so you always have to be watching her 
like a kid weird 
yeah exactly haha it is kinda 
haha is she doing anytthing this year 
no i dont think so shes all like i wanna get far away from fredericton but shes so unrealistic about it shes doesnt have a firm grasp on how the world works she thinks she can do whatever she wants without working hard 
haha i remeber last year she said she was going to go to makeup school in the uk 
yeah im not sure if that was ever true cause i dont think her family could afford it like she put it on instagram but i think it was kind of a lie 
haha i looked up the school when she posted the photo because she had blured the tuition it was ridiculously expensive 
lol yeah i did the same thing hows your semester going 
its good i really like my new classes what about you 
nice i think im gonna like it a lot more than last semester what classes are you taking 
microecon theory and econ stats were full year so im still in those then i have calculus computer systems and software systems what about u 
cool i have developmental psych social psych neuroscience theatre and stat its more reading than last term but i think itll be easier overall 
nice what is the title of your theater class 
its just intro to theatre its a continuation of last semester lol richard just messaged me out of the blue 
haha yeah he was drunk last night he is in montreal w and me and him were with ella last night 
haha yeah ella said she might see you how was it 
i was really surprised to see her haha 
haha yeah shes staying there for a while so you might end up seeing we again her 
haha yeah is she just up here hang out 
yeah she had her ged now so i think shes like just doing stuff to take up time haha what was she like when you saw her 
i dont know we went to some shitty club and then got chow mien haha she was pretty tame not super fucked up or anything so all and all it was a pretty normal time 
haha nice thats good to know she didnt get too crazy its probably cause you guys dont know her well enough to take care of her 
ahahagagagga so did u message richard back 
lol hows richard 
still richard haha he was pre drunk last night 
lol yeah i dont know if i should reply to him 
haha yeah he told me he messaged u last night it wasnt really clear why he prob misses u 
lol yeah maybe i still feel pretty bad about how we left things cause i said some pretty harsh stuff haha but at the same time i feel like he hasnt changed so i dont really want to start things up again lol 
haha all stuff he prob needed to hear 
yeah thats why i said it lol 
and yeah i dont know i do think university has changed his out look on life a bit 
okay thats good to hear ill probabily respond but not really start up a conversation its just so out of the blue haha 
yeah kinda hard to respond to haha 
lol yeah like where do i even start haha 
yeah really haha 
do you play quiz up 
no but i do play trivia crack 
lol kk im going to challenge you sometime haha you should get quizup though its good 
haha i had it 4 a bit its so specific 
lol yeah its funny doing the ones you know but for the other ones its just guesswork lol relevant httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8tifr9q1i8

lol 
what did you think of the ending 
the blackness 
no like the end of the actual serial haha 
oh i thought it was okay i wish that it was a little more yes or no but all and all i liked it what about u 
yeah i think they kinda had to end it that way but it definitely felt inconclusive i liked it though and im glad theres gonna be a season 2 did you hear theyre gonna appeal his case 
yeah i woonder what season 2 will be about 
yeah i bet itll be another cold case but maybe theyll try to find a case thatll be more conclusive haha 
ive heard it snt gonna b about murder 
oh really i guess it makes sense to switch it up when is it gonna start 
i dont know when it starts i think later this year also had my first tommy camp sighting today 
oh my god what was it like did he see you oh my god guess who got elected stu student union president 
oh no 
i pity the people of stu what is this world coming to 
haha i fear for all students in fredericton two best politicians i know 
haha travis is gonna be mayor in 20 years im calling it 
haha he kinda already looks like woodside 
haha so true httpswwwfacebookcomcisvinternationalphotosa49885131793227131330880825293210152931538852933type1theater thoughts 
i say that shit today it seems like a dumb idea to me apperently it is the logo only for social media which makes literally no sense what do u think 
i think its dumb like the whole reason they made a new logo was for like solidarity puposes now its just gonna look like theres 2 different logos 
yeah im pretty sure that any business student would tell u that having two logos is ridiculous dave has been telling me about the happening of cisv fredericton apperently justice has dropped out as ljr so hes all by his lonesome 
haha wow poor davo hows the chapter doing 
according to dave things are going well apperently the new juniour ljr is gonna be either georgia or ben lol 
lol i hope its georgia and i hope theres some younger kid as sassy as she was to sass her haha 
ahahahahaah yeah looking back on cisv the whole experience seems really weird and kinda surreal 
yeah i totally agree looking i kinda feel like we were too young to take on so much but then i remember how we didnt want the adults interfering haha 
haha yeah dave was telling me about the adult board intervening with mini camp planning seems like adult intervention is a never ending cycle 
haha yeah i bet theres like nothing you can do like youll always not want their help and theyll always think you need help 
haha yeah so how do u like your new house 
yeah its alright theres less room but its more cozy i guess haha im supposed to have my room in the basement so thatll be interesting not really sure how itll go cause it kinda smells weird in the basement haha 
ahaahahha do u have any noteworthy neighbors 
no well i mean except my grandfather lol oh wait do you know who matthew mukerjee is 
oh fuck the rapper 
lol yeah he lives across the street haha oh and i think sebastian edwards grandparents live down the street too 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0xhzbktxy5q tripple m haha thats a strange group 
ah oh my god that video 
thats classic fhs some horrible familiar faces 
haha im having flashbacks its kinda weird to see that crew in their natural habitat like that lol oh my god it makes fhs look so greasy haha 
luke beirne in that video in a puma jumpsuit 
lol ya i just sent the video to charlotte lol this comment johnny nassifs pedo stare in the background lol 
lol fcktit says it best 
haha i bet that was triple m himself oh my god did you hear the part where theyre like someone get him a beer 
aahah yeah there is a guy drinking a beer in the video 
lol good old nb have you found a place to live for next year in montreal 
still looking its such hassle to find a place not too worried tho have u found a spot 
yeah i feel the hassel me and my friend are gonna sign a lease next week but our third roommate backed out so we have to find another person are you gonna live alone 
no me josh liu and a guy from toront are all living together so that should be interesting what happened to you are third 
lol yeah that will be her dad didnt want her to live in the place cause we have to pay rent over the summerbut like all houses in halifax have 1 year leases so its really dumb it just sucks cause like theres nothing she can do and we all want her to live there 
thats really weird like thats just how rent works is it an apartment or a house 
its like a house but we have a unit in the house im pretty pumped cause theres a 6 guy house of all our friends that are gonna live across the street haha 
thats cool did u ever consider living with lucy 
lol last semester i was like i dont really want to live with her i hope she doesnt ask then she was like oh my god you are gonna be here next year maybe we can live together then like 2 seconds later she was like wait thats a bad idea like were best friends but too much of a good thing exists haha i was so glad we were on the same page 
haha yeah makes sense i dont know how living with josh liu will be im not a neat and tidy person but joshs dorm has multiple forms of mold growing in it 
haha hopefully he leaves the mess in his room whats the other guy like 
other dude is a business student hes a good dude hes also really smart what is you are roomate like 
shes pretty much my best friend in res besides my roommate i hope shell be good to live with 
haha is there a reason u didnt live with you are roommate 
shes on exchange so shes only here for this year 
oh weird where does she usually go 
she goes to university of glasgow but shes from england 
httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid891996174191652setmscejyzsds0tdqzmdextdq0mzpvswdzdc3bffmjagddbmsbpst1826702333type1theater okay neville 
oh my god what the hell happened haha 
haha looks like his dad 
oh my god yeah he does all he needs is a pony tail 
they are dating now lol what is she like 
watttt shes crazy lol 
oh no 
haha 
like how 
i dont know shes just kinda weird its hard to describe i was friends with her in middle school haha shes always cared a lot about being popular and having a boyfriend and shes really dramatic 
haha i hope it works out lol u workin 
just got home saw chris today though we were both wearing khakis 
haha he owns like 2 pairs of khakis and that is like all he wears when he works 
lol same but at least i have skirts to break it up haha so i heard a rumour that richard is moving back to fredericton to be with tess 
oh shit thought u knew yea aslo he didnt like business but yea haha 
wow im pretty surprised since he seemed so certain about business whats he gonna do at unb 
major in math he says 
lol nice i wonder how long him and tess will last 
haha yeah i dont know seems like things are going pretty good with them but yea 
yeah they seem good but i just dont trust her haha 
haha she seems fed up with him a lot of the time 
lol really why 
because she has to deal with richard haha he would be tough to date 
lol yeah this is true do you guys still talk 
oh yeah we hang out a lot 
aw cool has he changed much 
less ego now haha 
lol thats good to hear i ran into him at chinese new year and it was kinda awkward haha 
yeah what did u say 
oh like i was just going to sit down for the show and passed him and tess and he was like hey mia and i was like hey how are you then we sat down and i left as soon as the thing ended haha 
haha yea he came back to fredericton a lot this summer school year 
yeah i guess that would make sense since he has a girlfriend here i can see why he wouldnt like his program i bet its really competitive rad dad 
haha hes a total frat boy now 
i still dont really get how someone who did cisv ended up being a republican haha 
happy birthday 
thanks dan i heard u were at computer science camp 
yea im living in moncton and working as an instructor at the camp lol 
lol nice how is it are you like living in the camp or do u have you are own place 
its decent it really depends on the group of kids some kids are really funny and good to deal with but others are total dicks haha im living with family out here most of my aunts live back in freddy i mean moncton not fredericton 
haha are they strict 
haha my boss or my aunt 
you are aunt haha 
haha not at all she is really chill and gives me tons of ice cream how is the doe treating u 
haha ice cream no way its kinda boring just finished a huge photocopying job today they got me cake for my birthday today chris had a slice lol so yeah boring as fuck all i do is listen to this american life while doing remedial tasks 
haha are u listening to old episodes 
yeah im actually getting worried that im gonna run out of the ones that look interesting soon 
i started listening episode 1 and im trying to listen to all of them a second time i listened to them all when i was in 10th grade 
oh my god that must have taken forever i should probably start going through them systematically like that right now im just picking a year at random and choosing an interesting one what episode are you in right now 
47 i think i have a long way to go lol some of the old ones are kinda bad lol when u moving back up to dal 
yeah i think so too hahai have to be back by august 31st for job training im working front desk at my old residence haha 
haha what does front desk do at a res 
not sure yet from what ive seen mostly watch netflix and give people their keys back haha but im kinda worried cause you need to pay attention to security and some homeless guys walked in last winter 
haha that sounds pretty dope except for the security part have u moved into you are house yet 
im actually going this weekend to move my furniture in basically i just raided my grandfathers house and it had everything you totally have to visit it sometime its filled with awesome stuff 
i think ive seen some snapchat stories or instagram posts from inside it looks like its eternally in the 70s what stuff are u taking up 
yeah pretty much haha mostly furniture and dishes its pretty sweet that we wont have to look for anything in hali do you know what youre doing for your apt in montreal 
yea the previous tenets left us a bunch of stuff all i needed to buy was a bed and dresser 
thats awesome do you think youre gonna get along with you are roommates 
haha the apartment is def gonna be a fucking mess but other than that its gonna be pretty chill what about you 
well one of my roommates is like my best friend so i think itll be fine but we dont actually have a third roommate and we need one im meeting up with this girl this weekend and hopefully that works out looking at her profile she seems a bit social justicey but im hoping that wont affect my life too much lol 
haha send me a link to her profile i wanna judge 
this is her httpswwwfacebookcomtessdeliafrefts tell me what you think can you see her posts 
i can only really see her cover photos and prof pictures seems reasonable enough though haha is she at dal 
she just graduated from acadia she did poli sci and minored in art 
oh weird so what is she doing next year 
shes like doing research at dal im a bit rattled cause she shares like a ton of social justice posts like everyday i hope shes not that intense in real life 
haha so you are meeting her this weekend 
yup hopefully it works out we kinda cut off communication with everyone else i just hope shes easy going like she said in the ad haha theres this group of guys that are our friends living across the street from us and if shes aggressively political then i dont imagine they will get along which would be stressful 
haha are the guys not pc or somethinf 
lol yeah theyre not all but one are in engineering and they tend to be kinda conservative so we dont really talk about politics aha like theyre good friends but i avoid sensitive subjects cause it would just be awkward starting a fight 
hm like what 
well one of them likes stephen harper and theyre really not good with feminism and cultural stuff i think they just dont get it they dont seem to be well educated on it 
haha thats funny seems like a lot of scienceengineering guys are like that like almost completely clueless when it comes to stuff like that 
yeah thats what it seems like anyways it was kind of shocking to me at first like i couldnt believe that there were young people who liked harper so now i just assume that they are not educated enough to understand and are naive and just leave it at that 
haha yeah when ever i meet a young person who likes harper im just confused anyway im going to hit the hay big day tomorrow let me know how this weekend goes im curious to hear 
lol ya same i will totally it should be interesting anyways lol divorceddad 666 
haha i needed a sweet new instaname hha how halifax last weekend 
good the girl was really nice but she just emailed me today to say that shes gonna live with her parents this year instead so back to square one 
oh thats shitty other than that what did u get up to when u were there 
not much actually just chilled with my friends that were there theyre kind of a mess lol 
their place was a mess or they were 
they are lol like they wake up at 3 pm and go super hard every weekend at least 23 have jobs now but there was a point when they were all unemployed basically theyre broke haha 
haha why didnt they move homee 
i dont know i think they thought it would be a more productive summer one of them actually was home for a while and decided to come and one guys family moved to victoria so he doesnt know anyone there how has comp sci camp been going 
haha actually really well its a surprisingly rewarding job tomorrow is my last day in moncton then im back to fred 
thats awesome what kind if stuff do you do there wow back so soon lol 
just like teaching kids how to program yea its 4 weeks here then 2 weeks in fred 
oh so theres a camp here too or are you just chillin here 
yea there is camp there too i dont go back up to montreal till sept when u going back to dal 
i dont know its kinda tbd i just have to be there for the 31st so i imagine ill go close to then were driving so it doesnt really matter you excited for next year 
yea i am reallly pumped i cant wait to go back it will be sweet to living in a apartment 
yeah i feel the same way im a little worried about having roommates but i think itll be chill 
ye me too a bit both of mine are really messy so my place will turn into a shithole after prob 1 month 
lol that sucks that would drive me crazy like i dont mind if its in you are own room but i cant handle a nasty kitchen 
ye nasty kitchens are horrible i care about is keeping that clean otherwise i dont care 
lol hopefully that works out well i gotta sleep but talk to you later 
okay night 
i dont even know never would i ever have predicted 
i wonder how long it will last 
who knows i think shes gonna get pregnant soon to be honest lol 
haha bold prediction haha have u found a new roomate yet 
yes we did her name is larrissa rawn if u wanna creep lol it was kinda bitter sweet cause we had to say no to this really nice spanish exchange student 
why did u have to say no because she wasnt gonna be here long enough 
yeah shes only staying for a semester we skyped and she was like super nice and were probabily gonna hang out in halifax anyways haha 
haha so what is larrissa like 
shes like really intense 
haha 
shes doing a double major and says she wants to either go to pharmacy or medical school and shes like really into sports apparently id rather have her than some person that just stays around the apartment and does nothing 
yea that makes sense im curious to hear how it turns out 
yeah same haha i feel like shes gonna be intimidating 
i creeped her she seems to have wild eyes 
lol yeah i know right hopefully its just a bad first impression i think shes gonna end up just being basic 
haha basic is better than bitch i guess haha 
yeah thats what im thinking haha the other thing thats gonna be weird about the house is my other roommate is now dating out friend our so theres a chance hes gonna basically live with us too s 
haha that could end poorly if they break up 
yeah im just not gonna think about it haha theyre like superrrr into each other right now so hopefully it lasts apparently the guys at his house are already annoyed 
haha thats a good start 
apparently he skyped her everyday for hours and it makes their wifi shitty haha 
ahhaa the best way to make a dude mad is to mess with the wifi lol 
ahahahhaa aint that the truth hey do you wanna take a first aid corse next weekend i need to do it for work and im trying to find someone to do it with so its not as boring haha 
im going to shediac next weekend srry but enjoy the course haha 
aw too bad thanks though haha oh my god have u seen this httpsitunesapplecomuspodcastthatamericanlifeid660963127mt2 
haha no is it good 
havent listened to it yet but i want too i dont think theyve been making new episodes though 
agaha its so many episodes to spoof does the guy on the left look like max kerr to u 
lol like a bit i see a resemblance haha do u follow him 
haha no i dont follow him i never really liked the guy to be honest 
lol ya i remember haha i have so many people from national stuff on facebook its so overwhelming but i feel like i cant delete anyone haha 
ye so true i like most of thembut at the same time i rlly dont care about most of their posts do you have taylor bond on facebook 
ya i feel the same way ya i do 
do u ever read his posts where he is like today im thankful for 
ya they always come up on my feed less so lately though what do you think of them 
haha i actually like them i guess i just like to think of the circumstances that lead to him being thankful about those specific things in that day they are always like today i am thankful for social justice bagged milk and family 
lol yeah i like them too i do the same thing like think of what he did that day i like that theres a bit of mystery to them haha 
haha good to hear im not alone in that hows school going 
decent pretty much all my classes are relatively easy this term which is good oh my god and aaron alexander stairs is in my intro to architecture class i was like hey that guy looks like aaronomg it is aaron 
shit thats nuts my brother said the last that he had heard from aaron was that he had dropped out of mta for the second time and was smoking copious amounts of weed so its good to hear he is back in school lol 
haha yeah i heard the same he said that he wasnt really in school the last 2 years i remember he tried to get into u of t architecture out of high school and didnt get in so i guess hes giving it another shot lol do u see you are bro a lot 
ye we have have a class together and i live closer to campus than him so he comes over fairly often 
lol nice what class 
its a class called underground economics its about the criminal economy 
nice how are you are other classes going 
the work load is pretty heavy but i like them all what classes are u in 
at least youre interested i have my intro to architecture class then i have another arch class called visual thinking then i have personality linear algebra and a genetics class that has a psych angle overall pretty chill linear algebra is super easy what classes r u taking 
operating systems intro to algorithms calculus 2 underground economics and honours macro those architecture class sound really good 
sounds like a rough term yeah theyre pretty fun so far its nice having to draw for school it makes me actually do it haha 
httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid10153517154845861setp10153517154845861type3theater 
oh my god lol are they dating 
i dont know who is the girl should we warn her lol 
lol if shes posting pictures of him then i think its too late u coming home for thxgiving also i cant tell if this is ironic 
no im visiting my cousins in new hampshire also i dont think that photo is ironic just really cringe worthy 
nice a classic allamerican canadian thxgiving yeah thats what i suspected also have u voted yet 
ye i did good old matty d have u 
nice not yet i was going to today and the i was like im not ready but i think ill vote for him too hes the strongest opposing candidate in our riding 
haha all the candidates are trash in our riding in my opinion but yea he is the only person who can beat keith 
lol true its funny that we know him i wonder if he remembers us 
aaha yea i wonder that too mean i feel i met him like 3 times 
yeah i know was he a leader 
yea he lead a delegation to norway a year after we went to sin city 
okay yeah thats what i thought oh was it the michael leger madeline messenger etc one 
ye 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjjns6naup1g 
haha what the fuck 
lol i know my friend showed it to me theres other similar videos on her channel haha httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaiex5rfxz20 topical 
haha how did you are friend find it 
lol she like goes through the comments on videos she watches and creeps ppls google plus accounts at random my creepy roommate haha 
haha is the one who u found over the summer 
no just my friend from last yeah haha 
httpwwwcbccaincludesfederalelectiondashboardindexhtmlrtb the streme is on there stream 
thanks so far so good dont wanna jinx it though haha 
same i dont think harper will win tho my mom made that pie 2day and sent me a picture lol 
haha oh my god love it good old pegi i bet she didnt even put that on facebook 
haha one day she will get facebook 
then shell troll you and comment on all you are shit just like all the other moms 
haha nothing worse than a mom with facebook 
haha did u make that 
ye lol 
love it wheres the background from 
i googled 90s graphic lol 
haha good candidate for a dank meme matty d won 
ye this is nuts so far did u vote 
yup for the libs lol i think everyone in atlantic canada is on the same page lol 
yea i voted lib 2 did u vote in fred or hali 
fred my riding in hali was always ndp so fred was the best option cbc has me feeling bad about the ndp haha 
haha yea kinda sad i think everyone wanted to play it safe and not split the vote 
yeah definitely thats how i was feeling at least we just cant afford to reelect harper this time 
yea true its cool that there is a cisver in parliament lol 
i know i wonder if anyone will post it in one of the 1000 cisv groups haha 
haha ye there really are a lot of cisv groups 
i dont know how many i am in but i should really just turn the notifications off lol i get at least one a day 
yea i turn off all mine it is overwhelming 
its kinda weird feeling so removed from it do you think youll be a leaderstaff 
um maybe but i dont know when i would do it because i need to work like every summer what about you 
i dont know i feel the same way like i always wanted to but now that i could actually do it soon i feel like im gonna be pretty busy for the next few years 
yeah it kinda makes me think about how our leaders were able to do it 
i know this summer i could theoretically lead a village delegation and definitely dont think i have my shit together for that haha i kinda get why parents get nervous sending their kids away now 
haha yea i remember when i was a kid that i didnt differentiate between like 20 year olds and 40 years in terms of responsibility 
so true i hate being 20 haha i feel like im in a midlife crisis 
yea i feel that i am just trying to not look to my future httpswwwfacebookcomvideophpv10153114101656937 chris murray in back 
oh my god haha what is he even doing there 
httpswwwfacebookcomkeithashfieldmpfrederictonphotospb39059279100485822075200001445459025952016924862439type3theater i guess he is conservative 
thats so bizarre i guess you never know who is conservative lol i wonder if its like a family thing 
i think so i saw a picture of his brother on keith ashfields facebook page lol 
lol so awkward maxs parents are actually conservative or at least they were not sure about recently his grandfather was like an mp or something in ontario 
yea my mom told me that apparently maxs granddad was a pretty famous politician 
yeah apparently there are political cartoons of him i think my dad has a book but im not sure 
haha that must have been weird for maxs dad growing up 
yeah i would think so i actually dont know much about it all i know is that his sister turned into a crazy cat lady and took over the family house in spencers island where i used to go for thanksgiving haha 
haha weird do u talk much to max anymore 
haha sort of we dont really talk that much but were kinda like family so nothing really changes once we see each other oh and i saw him on thanksgiving 
yea that makes sense 
martha might be living with me next semester actually haha larrissa applied for pharmacy school in australia and if she gets a scholarship then shes not coming back for second semester 
damn that cool 
then martha was saying she was interested at thanksgiving 
is martha done university 
yeah its super cool she already got in but she cant go if theres no scholarship ya she finished in december cause she started a semester late finishes 
so what is she gonna do in hali 
lol no idea rachel forrestall and ashley corbett live here though so i imagine shes just gonna chill with them 
oh cool what did she take 
lol not sure some arts degree and i think a gender and womens studies minor 
ah kk 
is chris still doing poly sci 
double poli sci and econ yea 
lol nice you still doing econ and comp sci 
yea rock and roll u still pych 
yup also gonna minor stats 
oh that cool stats is pretty interesting 
yeah i like it so far i was thinking of switching to a double major but i did really bad on my midterm yesterday so shelving that idea for a while lol wow u didnt get tagged in this harsh 
ouch lol 
u should like the post lol 
this is the weirdest engagement announcement ive ever seen 
haha yeah i saw that good show though haha 
ahaham lol i wasnt a fan 
lol i liked it not enough to pair it with an engagement announcement though haha oh my god that old video of u eating the egg ah 
haha did that show up in you are feed 
since i commented on it originally i got a notification actually haha 
oh lol 
did u guys ever end up finishing it 
no not even close lol what a waste 
haha was that the one where u were crazy 
lol yea 
i think i filmed a scene for that i was like a counsellor or something 
yeah i remember that in stu lol hows university 
yeah haha its going okay getting close examz lol i just finished this architecture term assignment hows it going for u 
cool what was the assignment its good 4 me just ready 2 be done lol 
lol same haha it was like a poster for an exhibit on a specific architect i can show it to you later if u wanna see it haha 
yea defiantly when is you are last exam 
the 19th u 
21st lol are u taking maritime bus home 
aw that sucks no lucy has a car and we finish on the same day so it works out good i had to take the bus for thxgiving and it was so bad 
yea maritime bus is a shit show lol that cool that lucy has a car does she use it often 
i hate it have you ever taken it from montreal she doesnt use it that much actually since everything is pretty close she does take me to get groceries though haha 
lol yea im a maritime bus veteran i have take the montreal freddy ride like 10 times now it is the worst 12 hours a guy could ask 4 
holy shit that sounds awful does chris go with u 
yea most of the time and josh liu and jack ball a couple of times 
aw thats cool do you and jballer still hang out and stuff he seems to be having a lot of fun with his roomies from what i can see on facebook haha what the fuck did they just drop this without warning 
holy shit helll yes i have been checking the website over the past couple of months and it didnt really say anything so good 
cant wait to listen to it i bet they didnt really know when they were gonna be ready haha have you listened yet 
no not yet have a final today so im going to listen after it 
lol same what exam do you have 
operating systems what about you 
linear algebra 
shitty is it gonna be hard 
the content isnt that bad its just a lot of shit to remember haha no formula sheet and a lot of theory u 
yea its a 4th year engineering course and the prof is good at being really vague it like one of those classes where no one does well in it so u dont fell bad getting a bad mark lol 
oh my god that sounds brutallll is it a required course or regretted elective 
haha i thought it was required turns out it isnt lol i actually really liked the class we did some cool assignments its just frustratingly hard is this you are second lin alg course 
thats cool at least you got something out of it thats kinda how i felt about discrete math last year haha its my first one actually it has a part 2 but i dont need to take it its not that bad for something i didnt know much about beforehand and the prof is awesome so its pretty chill 
when do u write 
7pm u 
6 but 7 you are time lol are u ready 
lol nice not really i feel like id be ready if it was tomorrow lol what about u 
i dont know i feel like i have learned all i can learn at this point lol 
yeah like what more can you do at this point the prof will probably curve it too most engineering classes are like that from what i hear 
yeahat this point i just want finals to be over lol 
lol yeah pretty much how many more exams do you have after this 
2 more what about you 
same and i have like a week to study for them after this what are yours in 
lol me too after this one mine next one is a week away i have honours macro and intro algorithms what about you 
those sound terrible i have personality and then genes brain and behaviour which is like a mix of neuroscience and bio 
that sounds cool did u write an exam yesterday 
no we didnt have exams yesterday did you 
ye i had calc2 yesterday 
im gonna take that in the summer was it bad 
the course itself is easy as in none of the concepts are hard but sometimes integration can be tough to do 
okay that sounds good i dont mind integration actually haha 
hey how did it go 
it went alright got stuck on a few questions but i dont think it brought my mark down howd it go for you 
that good lol mine was as i expected really tough but it was all good in the end like everyone thought it was tough so it will scale prob 
ya like as long as youre in a certain percentile it should all work out haha lol is david in montreal right now 
lol no that photo is from the summer i dont know why he just posted it lol 
lol i heard he got i to dal is he gonna go 
he told me he is going to dal if he doesnt get into mcgillbut he doesnt hear back from mcgill until spring 
haha thatd be so funny if u guys all went to mcgill does he know what he wants to study 
yea it would be really weird i hope he comes here so i can use his meal plan i think he wants to study chem or bio but i dont think he really knows 
haha priorities it would be really funny if you guys all decided to live together 
haha yea that would be ridiculous do jonathan know where he is gonna go does 
all he knows is that he wants to go far away lol probabily alberta or somewhere with a tennis program anna was telling me how the other day died was like oh jonathan youre growing up so fast so youre gonna leave and never visit us and he just didnt say anything cause its kinda true lol 
haha does jonathan not like died 
lol i think she can just be a bit much sometimes i dont know if you go over there a lot but they all fight all the time haha 
haha i never go over there but that doesnt really surprise me the only interactions i have with died is when she comes over to my house and drinks wine with my mom lol 
haha wine moms yeah it gets especially awkward when they bring me into it like died will go what do you think mia is anna being unreasonable and im just like uh haha i dont know 
lol that would be really awkward is anna home now 
yeah shes just studying at home but she still has exams 
thats sweet studying at home would be really nice 
yeah it would be nice not to make meals but at the same time i find theres way more distractions thats just what i remember from being at unb so maybe i just didnt want to study science haha 
haha oh yea i totally forgot that you went to unb for a year lol 
lol ya i forget most of the time too to be honest sometimes ill go there to study while im home and its weird see all these people that were in my classes 
haha its pretty dope that u transferred it would have been so easy to just stay 
yeah i almost did i was originally gonna go to ottawa and was super disappointed with the campuses i toured and i even forgot i applied to dal the only reason i went is cause they sent me a letter saying that i hadnt paid my registration fee honestly i probably should have just went in first year lol 
is the transfer going to set back you are graduation 
nope i actually gained a credit by accident cause they gave me my physics credit even though i didnt take a physics lab ive decided to double in psych and stats and i can still graduate in 4 years so thats pretty cool lol 
thats sweet stats seems really interesting to me 
yeah im liking it so far i think it would be a cool job have u been liking comp sci or econ more 
yea i find it all really interesting happy with my choice thus far do u think you are gonna do grad school 
thats good no psych is really competitive and i just dont think i like it enough to go through with it the field itself academically is not really what i thought it would be what about you lol saw abbey rachel kendall and cassidy allan at the capital tonight 
lol did u talk to them 
just smiled and waved haha 
lol was old richard du there 
no didnt see him i dont know he could have gone though 
i know they were hanging out 2nite and a bunch of people went to snooty fox 
lol nice you didnt go 
no still in montreal 
oh yes shit thats so sad have you gone to the capital before 
yea i went like once a week in the summer lol funny place 
ya its pretty hit and miss i feel like u just kinda go to run into people haha 
yea was there a show there tonight 
lol ya there were people playing stuff i didnt pay much attention 
haha oh fun fact i think jack ball and robbie lynn are in an improv group that does shows at the cap 
oh my god for real i had no idea that was a thing 
nor did i 
sounds like something they would do though lol 
i havent seen them do a show and i dont really want to i think it would be kinda cringy 
ya i feel like theres no way it couldnt be just cause we know them u wanna skype 
i cant im studying for my final tomorrow 
ah so sad what final 
algorithms 
shit well ill leave ya to it then good luk 
haha thanks have fun 
thanks haha cant tell if i should start listening to this podcast httpwwwworstideaofalltimecomabouthtml 
that sounds like it could be really good im going to listen lol 
lol ya i think i will too i dont know how good it would be to binge though 
lol true i guess it will depend on how interesting the dudes are 
yeah im listening now to see it would have been better if you were there from the start 
ye the episodes seem pretty short 
haha true not sure id want to listen to them talk about sex and the city 2 for more than that though lol 
lol ye true have u been listening to serial 
im a little behind cause i listen to it before i go to bed and end up falling asleep haha you 
aha yea im up to date its pretty good but its no season 1 
yeah from what ive heard of it i agree i think people just seem to be more drawn to murder cases happy birthday no longer a swaggy teen 
haha thanks did u listen to the worst idea of all time 
lol ya ive listened to the last couple of eps u 
i went to the first episode and started listening im on episode 40 of season 1 
whoaa haha is it worth doing 
haha i enjoyed it its really light so i listen when i am doing something else 
yeah ive found that with the ones ive listened to so have u watched grown ups 2 then haha 
haha yea its was amazingly bad i watched it like 2 days ago 
lol i imagine it would be ive seen sex and the city 2 so thats why ive been listening to the more recent ones also a terrible movie i really wanna try watching a bad movie like that every week to see what its like 
haha like the same movie every week 
yeah just like how they do it i want to see how bad it is 
oh haha yea i feel like it wouldnt be as bad as they say 
i guess it would depend on the movie 
haha yea true what movie do you think you have seen the most 
hm thats a good question i feel like ive seen a lot of movies like 57 times and then after that i cant really think of anything you 
um yea same there are no movies i have seen like a sickening number of times but joli mcgraw has seen pitch perfect something like 45 times lol 
haha thats insane why 
i have no idea when i asked her she just said its a good movie 
i guess if you like it 
haha have u seen it 
oh yeah at least like 4 times lol i havent seen the second one though i like it but i think it would get old after 45 watches haha 
haha yea true how are things this semester for you 
good ive got lab classes this semester and no math classes so its definitely a different feel than last semester 
thats sweet what kind of lab classes 
research methods in memory and experimental social psych hows you are semester so far 
oh that sounds really cool my semester is just easier than last semester but i have one prof who is fucked like he is a climate change denier 
lol what what does he teach 
this econ class called current topics in economics 
wow thats pretty fucked i guess climate change and economics dont really intersect or do they 
in ecological econ they do but i doubt he will touch on that in the course how do u like you are profs 
3 are great 1 is okay and i hate 1 lol apparently lucy said that she overheard that my forensic psych prof was spotted at the club that all the students go to 
haha shades of rutledge is that prof the same prof as the one u hate 
lol so true no hes okay just sketchy cause of that the guy i hate is my intro to architecture prof hes super pretentious and has a huge ego he like uses his travel pictures and his friends work as examples in class 
aahahah is he old 
yup howd u know 
haha just a hunch old people always thinks they are sweet 
true yeah im extra mad cause yesterday he called my project concept a cute idea 
haha wow what a condescending prick whats his name 
peter henry hes got mixed reviews but i feel like the people who like him have just never met an architect before and believe everything he says haha 
haha 
what are you are profs like 
other than the one fucker i really like all of my other profs although one of my profs only knows how to whisper lol 
haha thats good i hate when profs dont speak up its like the vocal equivalent of writing small on the board 
ahahaahhaahahah so true 
hey so im actually gonna be in montreal from the 15th to the 18th we should hang if you are not too busy 
ye sure you can see my shitty apartment what are u coming up for 
lol its my reading week so me and lucy are coming up to visit ella lucys boyfriend is actually coming to visit his own friends also haha 
haha oh cool you are reading week is so early 
yeah i know it sucks my parents are going to florida without me haha when is yours 
first week in march 
yeah that makes way more sense i dont know why ours is like that 
lol its funny that you are rents are going to florida without u 
lol yeah im kinda used to it now theyve already been to new zealand and portugal without me 
did they go back to nz since you have been back from nz that is 
lol yeah they went when i was in first year for like 2 months 
oh shit haha 
lol ya they suck haha 
i read you are dads rate my prof the other day lol 
lol oh yeah 
haha yea he has a really good score and all the comment about him are really nice 
lol yeah i think ive read it too good to know also super glad there were no chili peppers lol some of my friends parents have them 
hahahh doesnt jim gilbert walsh have one 
lol yeah sam beckleys dad had one too 
haha all my friends parents have good ratings except for richards dad 
haha what do they say 
this man did not know up from down he was more confused more than he was a statistician usually he could not explain his own examples and would spend more time giggling trying to figure out what the answer was than teaching the actual course i always recite this to richard 
lol too good what subject does he teach math 
yea business stats a few of our friends have had him 
oh really what do they say 
they all thought he was goodish prob not super good because his english isnt that good some one did mention his giggling tho haha 
lol if i wonder what hes thinking about it must make the class uncomfortable haha 
ahahaa yea have u ever talked to him b4 
haha good question i honestly cant remember probabily not like a legit conversation 
haha talking to him is really hard 
lol really is it the accent 
not even understanding him he is like one of those guys who seems really out of it and sometimes when i ask him a question he just laughs no real response 
thats hilarious i couldnt imagine him being my dad lol 
haha yea 
hey my number is 5064711313 im coming in tomorrow night so txt me if you are free this week 
alright sounds good how long are you going to be here 
im leaving at 1130pm on the 18th

haha did u say hi 
ya i didnt see him but he was like mia and i turned around and we had a chat haha 
lol do i know him well 
not really after we chatted i was trying to think of the last time we interacted and i couldnt think of anything haha 
haha daniel he is a very weird man 
haha oh really ive never heard anything about him how is he weird 
he is really motivated to become a doctor so now he is like a total try hard in university lol 
lol ya i can see that he said he was in halifax for some sort of conference 
yea he was at mcgill for a conference this week too 
lol thats cray did u see him 
yea i hung out with him for a bit httpswwwfacebookcomfrederictonpolicephotosa86040353397092610737418308399992326780231183491784995431type3theater 
holy shit i hope everythings okay 
yea really 
how did u find the post did someone share it or something 
my brother sent it to me 
i met someone who is also doing econ and computer science today 
wow another beautiful snow flake was it a dude 
haha it was a girl actually shes here visiting my friends girlfriend lol 
wow that seems even more rare haha where does she go 
she goes to school on boston like wellesley or something its a womens college lol 
oh weird 
apparently hillary clinton went there 
lol oh guess who i saw today ari polo 
whoa no way thats so awesome how did it go 
it was really fun to see her she is really laid back so it was really easy to chat with her like old times 
thats cool yeah shes great theres this girl i know from my summer camp who lives in montreal but i wasnt sure if i should ask her to hand or not cause i was worried it would be awkward haha 
haha where is she from 
shes from lebanon but her moms canadian or something httpswwwfacebookcomsariyaidrissfrefts this is her in case you ever see her haha 
haha i keep an eye out for her 
hows school going 
pretty decent 3 weeks till finals so im feeling the pressure what about you 
lol i feel that i only have one exam so i basically have a shit ton of final projects due in the next week dont think ill be sleeping much lol 
shitty are u still planning on working on you are portfolio this summer 
yup going back to hali for a course in july though are you still looking for comp sci jobs in freddy 
i am interviewing at a start up from fredericton tomorrow actually its my second interview with them so hopefully it goes well if i dont get that job i have an offer 2 run a comp sci camp in the city but dont really want 2 work with kids 
haha didnt you do that last year 
yea kinda id be working for the same dude but i would be running my own camp this year 
wow that sounds intense hopefully you get the startup job haha 
yea i hope so too what july course are u taking 
intermediate calculus its a pre requisite for a course in the fall i hope its not too bad im kind of excited cause it means i get to take 4 courses instead of 5 for a semester 
oh thats cool 
yeah im gonna take cryptography in second semester now since i wont be as busy gonna play the grown ups 2 drinking game tonight haha 
agahahha you are gonna get faded 
ya im a little worried have u done it 
no but i have read the list and its seems brutal 
ive been really curious about the movie and im afraid to watch it sober lol 
haha drunk is the only way are u playing it with a big group 
ive convince one friend to watch it with me and im gonna try to get more people 
haha thats a tall order 
i dont think i can get a lot of people into watching grown ups 2 tho lol im surprised i convinced one person i dont think hes aware of how bad it is thinking of taking first year econ would u recommend 
is it micro or macro 
probabily micro but i think i could do either 
micro is definitely less interesting than macro is it a one semester course 
yeah like micro and macro are 2 different courses micro has a better time slot so ill see haha are they really different 
they are pretty different like macro you get to study fiscal and monetary policy and how countries react to changes in the world market in micro you learn more about how individuals make decisions and the effect of aggregate decision making and some game theory stuff both classes are good in my opinion i prob like macro better because my prof is really good 
haha they both seem pretty cool maybe ill take both apparently the tests arent too hard here and i need something chill for next year lol httpwwwkijijicavlonglostrelationshipscityofhalifaxpleasehelpmefindthisman1132609775enablesearchnavigationflagtrue 
ahahahahhahahahhahahahahha brwnbootyhotmailcom must be a different robbie lynn tho 
i hope its actually robbie the ad looks too cringe to be real lol we should crash the wedding 
haha we should i am offended that we were not invited 
low key actually offended haha i guess it makes sense since we literally havent talked for years lol hows you are job going 
qhaha yeah i dont even think i would want 2 go lol my job is good it can be kinda intense but my bosses are all really nice hows you are summer 
thats good died was telling me how you got the job and how you had to like solve a problem in front of them or something haha my summers been pretty good i couldnt get a job cause im taking a summer course in july and so im just chilling basically lol 
yeah most programming interviews they make you do that but the problem wasnt too hard i saw photos from you are trip where were u 
i went to vancouver and banff also i was in calgary for the day it was pretty fun we passed by the hotel nbm was in when we were in vancouver lol it was a tbt is chris working at marysville place this summer 
haha that place we were was kinda cool no chris doesnt have a job right now lol 
lol the unemployed life is pretty sweet oh yeah ive been meaning to ask is david going to dal or did he end up choosing mcgill 
haha he really hates not having a job lol he is going to mcgill 
i guess its not that awesome when youve graduated and the search is on for an actual career haha oh my god that nicholas decarie guy from modelun just added ella on snapchat 
haha thats dude wwas so weird did she accept 
oh my god i know one of my favourite people to creep haha she has a public snapchat so anyone can just add her her snaps are pretty annoying to be honest haha 
oh what is public snapchat 
its in you are settings basically it just means that anyone that has you are username can add you and view your stories automatically as opposed to them needing to add you back i think you can send them snaps too 
oh weird haha is she snap famous 
haha not really she just has her username in her instagram profile so its mainly just a few people here and there adding her i think like 300 people watch her stories 
oh thats cool so now that you are back in freddy what are u doing w you are time 
ive been trying to do some art but mostly im getting distracted by hanging out with friends haha speaking of which we should hang out before i leave 
yea defiantly when do u leave

thats crazy i watch a bunch of youtube videos about it yesterday pretty weird 
i feel like i wouldnt like the guys who go there haha they kinda seem like intellectual douchebags 
yea the guys in the video all seemed like rich kids who want to be writers 
oh my god youre still in nb i presume 
no im in montreal right now but i capped this like 2 days ago lol 
lol i was gonna say alex doesnt really fit the montreal vibe haha what does one common connection mean 
it means i have a mutual friend with the person lol 
oh lol that would probably happen a lot when youre in fred eh 
haha yea there is usually at least one person usually from keswick 
lol all hicks are connected i guess lol at this 
haha what a ridiculous guy 
i hope he never changes the name back 
ahahhahahahahahahaha she is so scary 
i sent this to lucy and she said school spirit is her drug haha 
haha once after a dance i was cleaning up for src with her and we were talking and i was like i cant to leave high school and she was like i love fhs i love being here it makes me so happy 
oh my god haha thats so weird i just cant relate to that kind of person like not even loving learning but just like loving the place where you learn lol 
haha yea i dont get it all 
lol yeah how are you are classes going 
pretty good i am taking calculus 3 tho which is really fucking boring i am taking an art history class which is really cool how about you 
i think i took that this summer pretty brutal haha thats cool im taking a design drawing class as my elective and its pretty chill other than that im in math classes and theyre not too bad so far this girl in a couple of my math classes befriended me on like one of the first days shes kinda crazy but at least i have someone to go over the assignments with haha 
haha crazy in what way 
lol its hard to put my finger on it exactly shes very weird haha like the first day i met her i overheard it was her birthday and then later she started talking to me and i legit thought she was drunk but thats just her and like shes super open about her sex life like last friday we drove to this party together and she was just telling me like all these details about the guys shes slept with and in my head i was like uh ive known u for 3 days hahahahahha 
ahahahahh yea she sounds off i wonder if she vapes maybe she was drunk 
haha only time will tell oh my god almost forgot her parents are mennonite and she was raised mennonite 
ahahahhahahaahahhaha that adds a whole new level link 
happy to oblige httpswwwfacebookcomgracemariedyckfrefts the multiple names on facebook is already a red flag lol 
haha i was just gonna say that 
its so true tho 
she seems strange based on you are facebook 
lol yeah like she posts weekly math jokes if you met her in real life youd be able to tell she was crazy right away lol httpbusinessfinancialpostcomnewstransportationmeetgaborlukacsthechildmathprodigyturnedprofessionalairlinetroublemaker this guy is my prof 
hahahahahahahhaha is he a good prof 
hes really nice but hes not very good at explaining things haha goes too fast through the material but im also reallllyyyy bad at financial math so i dont know if its just me 
haha bitter sweet based on the article he seems like a strange guy 
ya hes definitely not normal hell reference characters from operas in his assignment questions 
haha can u tell that he is really smart talking to him 
i wouldnt say really smart exactly haha but like when i found out he was a prodigy i was like that explains a lot lol like he looks really young for a prof and you can tell hes not socially adjusted i was thinking of dropping the class because i did so bad on the midterm but now i want to stay cause im like super interested in prodigiesgeniuses haha do you know this guy 
yea he was friends w my little bro back in the day y 
lol he lives in the res i work at didnt realize he was from freddy 
haha oh shit yea his family moved 2 kingston or london when dave was 12 did u ever meet his sister lauren craik she is you are age 
oh yeah her i know the name but dont recognize her after creeping lol she must have gone to albert 
james craft lol 
laughing my ass off i know weve been discussing it a lot in my group chat we were trying to guess how old he is 
haha yea he looks like he is 50 at least either that or he has aged extremely poorly 
lol yeah we guessed 50 too i wonder if my parents would recognize him i thought he looked familiar but then i realized it could just be cause he looks a lot like mark ruffalo haha 
haha mark ruffalo wishes he looked like the hunk of man meat i wonder what his job is 
lol yeah same i have so many questions like how did they meet and what does her mom think i bet hes french i just have a feeling haha 
haha he is def french 
lol glad were on the same page oh my god also this the comment was deleted when i went to check like 10 minutes later lol 
ahahhahhahahahahahhahhaahhahahahahahahhahah jesus thats so good evan morgan asking the real questions 
lol the only one brave enough to ask oh my god the shaaaadeeeee 
haha damn why did she put sugar daddy in quotes does she not think sugar daddies exist also taylyr got fucking shut down 
lol ya i dont get that either maybe its for a sarcastic effect lol ya taylyr got schooled the rest of the conversation 
haha holy shit i havent heard from you in years and we are family i would def not talk to jaymes if i were related 2 her im team taylyr 
same haha ya taylyr is just saying what we are all thinking oh shit waddup 
instagram famous have u seen his website 
no im too scared to creep lol have you 
lol yea its pretty lame he just posts about homework httpwwwwgertlercom 
the fuq why would you do that 
i am very curious as to who is target audience is 
it feels like hes trying to copy websites that profs have if youve ever come across those 
haha yea 100 that is what he is doing but like profs usually have relevant stuff on there his is like a lame diary pretty douchey bio lol 
lol exactly it all comes across as very vain to be honest hes so pretentious 
haha yea i feel like the only person he is fooling is himself 
i dont know youd be surprised theres a lot of idiots out there haha httpwwwmathstatdalcaselinger this is my favorite prof website my linear algebra prof from last year not sure if ive already showed it to u lol 
aaahahahahahahhahah oh my god that is so fucking good his menu is a picture what kind of guy is he 
its amazing definitely look through all of it when you get a chance he was like one of my favourite profs super entertaining he was like really outgoing and funny in his lectures but once i went to his office hours and he was kinda shy didnt expect it ive come to learn people are in math are usually fucking weird lol 
has he lost a lot of weight 
holy shit sure looks like it from that picture i heard a while ago that he did actually 
call him model gertler

hi daniel its me vinson from fhs i just wanted to ask you for some advice about mcgills econcomputer science program because its what i hope to study at university do you think you could give me some feedback on the program and what faculty youre in arts science or business 
hey vinson i am in the bachelors of arts and science program it basically allows you to pick one arts major and one science major the requirements for the science major within the arts science program are less than a normal science program for example if you do computer science in the faculty of science there are roughly 24 required courses but if you do computer science in the bachelor of arts and science program you only there are only 15 required courses the program of comp sci econ is actually really interesting and it requires you to use both sides of your brain i enjoy it so far the only drawback is the scheduling classes can be a little hectic because some comp sci classes are at the same time as econ classes but that is never really that big of a problem if you have any more questions feel free to ask 
cool dan do you think that artsscience faculty is the way to go i applied to physical sciences and business are you able to double major within both faculties also are the economics professors pretty good there like are there any world class people what about campus service centers and stuff do you think theyd be better than places like u of t or something okay well do you think the experience is worth it mcgill is also pretty expensive do you think the prestige the career opportunities and entrepreneurial environment is worth it 
i dont think that you can double major in science you can in business but comp sci isnt an option so if u want to do comp sci and econ you need to do art sci a lot of the econ prof are good and there are a couple who are considered great economists and are in the news on a semiregular basis as for resources for students mcgill is infamous for its bureaucratic system sometimes getting things done can be really frustrating 
oh okay 
overall i would say it is worth it it is a place where there is certainly a lot of opportunities that said it can be hard to stand out because there are a a lot of smart people here 
is an artssci degree valuable i heard that the degree is very regimented and difficult to cater to your needs do you find that too rigid also do employers even value artssci that much 
i dont know how valuable a art sci degree is versus a science degree my suspicion is that if you are looking to get a job in comp sci the company will care more about how strong of a programmer you are rather that your given faculty in that sense the comp sci job market seems fairly meritocratic 
what about in the field of econ do they value a harder science background as opposed to simple pure artsbusiness 
within econ i think that having compsci in your degree would really valuable it is a way to stand out from all of the other econ majors 
i personally would love to work with large organizations like government or in the entrepreneurial sector do you have like the same aspirations 
i have no idea what i want to do when i finish but probably a start up 
coolio man you know man i was reading over that advice you gave me and i realized that i ended that conversation abruptly and with more harshness and rudeness than i anticipated 
haha no worries 
so uh thanks for the advice i still plan on going to the program man so we should definitely hang out and stuff 
so have you got in to mcgill 
ive got arts acceptance and im really certain that ill get my artsci soon i submitted an extenuating circumstances letter so it takes longer but my top 5 average when including the 2 sciences math english is 926 
yea i presume that you will get in to artsci no problem 
just to check interim marks can still be used for admission right like marks as of this point for classes im undergoing right now 
yea you use you are midterm marks like you can use the report card marks you got last wednesday 
wait howd you know that have you been following me around school lurking stealthily in shadows i havent told anybody but my parents that i got those marks are you holding them hostage 
haha you caught me 
crap i dont know why i write ludicrous things anyways you still liking your second year in the program by the way 
ye still fun 
pretty fantastic brp o ya man i just got my acceptances to artsci and physical sciences lol convenient timing i guess well be seeing each other in a bit man because artsci is my first choice unless maybe if i get an offer from queens commerce which id probably reject anyways because of the cost campus elitism business curriculum and atmosphere 
congrats dude 
25 multiple choise we have couple chemical reaction we had to write and we have to balance it states types of reaction ionic and net ionic equation was it the disassociation all the mole stuff nmm some definitions like the create a chemical reaction u need a collision with sufficient energy and right orientation which is called the collision theory emperical molecular format its about that and one diagnostic ex halogen pop test thats about it oh wait that theory is collision reaction theory 
thanks now time to study 
daniel what did u put for chemistry work sheet 2 and 3 
havent started yet lol 
lol i thought u did it in class 
oh yeah i started it 2 is h and 3 is oh 
thats it 
ist the question about acid and and bases right 
yup it says what entity in water is characteristic of acids base 
ya those are the awnsers 
hey 
haha yeah are we still watching the cove 
yeah i think but has anyone gotten it this movie night is going to be terrible 
haha i know i think robbie is down loading it

asd hi dan as my schooling career continues it seems like more and more of my time is spend inside of the classroom as a result i feel as though i value my time outside of the classroom more and more my extracurricular activities include hockey model united nations crystal growing club childrens international summer villages cisv side for my extracurricular activities im also extremely passionate about film both viewing and acting and painting both film and art have acted as stress relief for me as well as a creative outlet damian rodrigues private i rolled outta bed splitting the blind justice for finger and index finger a ray of sunlight shot into his room peering out the window on the streets he saw nothing but elderly people of course not surprising damian was old too ever since the cure for the common death was discovered people would stop procreating creating an average age of 96 years old and rising despite all the intellectual power that it had taken to find the cure the scientist that over with one minor detail the weather youre probably wondering what the weather had anything to do with the elderly the truth is it is everything to do withwhat do all elderly people ha iin common they love talking about the weather this affect seemed almost temple pilots because with the cure for death they could no longer talk about their health problems its what you might call the perfect storm no pun intended damian couldnt stand it all this talk will it rain wanted whats the humidity going to be any chance of showers tomorrow he knew there had to be a way out of this he knew that the human race is more than just a bunch of mass is a flash talking about the weather give me instead of walking in the street towards his favorite watering hole the tiki lounge as he was deep in thought he sat down at the bar stool he looked over to mail the bartender and barked pina colada virgin his liver was what are used to be a few seconds later mel sweet over the favre eversion pina col seemingly sweating itself is condensation good for the side of the glass in the class was a straw and a mini umbrella damian worked up as mel b to speak so how about that weather damian refrain from throwing these drinks treadmills face incep with just mustard a groan damian plucked mini umbrella from the pina colada twirling a small would end between his fingers he stare longingly at the window and then it hit him how could i have been so dense damian thought it was in front of me the entire time how many virgin pina coladas have i sipped with the answer in the class the entire time glanced at the mini umbrella in between his fingers and the smirk way to chris face here enter the tiki lounge and down the street to umbrellas emporium purchasing as many umbr he touched the umbrellas together in walking strands creating a grade of open umbrellas even stronger bros from one end of the street to the other creating a canopy over the people below in the days to follow he would do the same for all the streets a city covering them with umbrellas so that the weather was never sunny but never rain never too hot and never too cold it was perfect damien solve the problem now we no longer have to hear about the weather httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid10200852233408061seta161019145461120830301230973834type1theater the myth vibrating beneath the surface of macbeth is one of the original myths that of the fall from the state of grace that it is a source of the plays power suggests its continuing relevance to the human situation its truth the manner in which the myth is manifested in macbeth is perhaps best suggested by lady macbethlook like the innocent flowerbut be the serpent underti v 656the flower suggests creation and links itself with the plays many images of growing things the serpent suggests the deception which slithered into eden to tempt evelady macbeth here is the tempting serpent and of course is also the deceived in that macbeth is a man in a fallen world the play concerns the further fall of man the loss of his soul but in that macbeth stands closest to royal favour with the exception of malcolm in a potentially redeemable world his fall parallels that of lucifer who stood closest to god with the exception of the son the fall of macbeth draws for its precedent on the first and last books of the bible a fact which suggests the fundamental implications of his crime christian philosophy says walter c curry recognizes two tragedies of cosmic importance 1 the fall of lucifer and a third part of the angelic hosts who rebelled against god and were cast out and 2 that fall of adam who was originally endowed with perfection and freedom but who set his will against gods will and so brought sin and limited freedom upon mankind the fall of macbeth draws on the combined power of those of lucifer and adamthe power beneath the surface then is the myth of that fall from a state of grace whether the fall from the beneficent light of god or the expulsion from paradise on earth the myth has three basic manifestations in macbeth moral ambiguity and decision feminine persuasion and cosmic retributionmacbeth is projected into a fallen world one which seems to have eaten of the fruit of the tree of good and evil and which cannot tell the two apart there are the obvious ambiguities fair is foul and foul is fair i i 11 fair and foul i iii 38 which resound so ominously through the early portions of the playthe words of the opening scenes are like those two spent swimmers of whom the wounded soldier speaks they cling together and choke their art i ii 89 often the lines say two things about macbeth they praise him as hero and prophetlike predict his coming treasonnorway himselfwith terrible numbersassisted by that most disloyal traitorthe thane of cawdor began a dismal conflicttill that bellonas bridegroom lappd in proofconfronted him with selfcomparisonspoint against point rebellious arm gainst arm i ii 516the lines are constructed to suggest that macbeth confronted cawdor as well as sweno a self comparison which becomes an ominous mirror reflecting treason present and future the hint is reinforced by the adjective rebellious which points across the sentence to modify the second arm macbethsthe actions of duncan during the opening scenes share the predominant ambiguous quality he attempts to engender eden on earth yet helps to promote his murder as macbeth returns from battle duncan assumes the role of creator his rightful role within the kingdom of scotlandi have begun to plant thee and will labourto make thee full of growing i iv 289 macbeth is in a state of grace the choice of remaining in eden under this beneficent aegis is his but while attempting to encourage eden duncan unconsciously promotes treason the king invests macbeth with the traitors title thus prompting macbeth to assume the traitors realitythe language of the opening scenes intermingles the possibilities of good and evil suggesting the terms of macbeths decision ironically as he comes closer to killing duncan his awareness of the heinousness of the crime becomes clearer like adam macbeth knows clearly what gods word is and what the general results of duncans murder must behis virtueswill plead like angels trumpettongud againstthe deep damnations of his takingoff i vii 1820an act which would outrage angels involves the perpetrator in damnation the dimensions of the fall are suggested by the drop from angels trumpet tongud to deep damnation the attainment of black and deep desires will have the deepest consequence i iii 126any discussion of adams temptation or of macbeths must involve eve or lady macbeth the element of feminine persuasion the spur of which macbeth speaks at the end of his soliloquy while lady macbeth is linked unmistakably with the weird sisters the temptation scene rings with echoes of edenmacbeth hath he asked for melady m know you not he hasi vii 30god walked through eden calling where art thou to adam this gives context to macbeths departure from the banquet scene and to his subsequent guilt as seen in his soliloquy macbeth can only explain his sinful conscience to his wife in materialistic termsi have boughtgolden opinions from all sort of peoplewhich would be worn now in their newest glossnot cast aside so sooni vii 325his argument is conditioned by her inability at this point in the play to see beyond the tangiblebut to employ a materialistic excuse for not pursuing a materialistic course is to open oneself up for counterattack lady macbeth retorts implying with a sneer that cowardice lurks behind the thane when you durst do it then you were a man i vii 49the roles of eve and lady macbeth coincide each ignites the ambition latent within her husbands breastmore permanent than failure in this life however and more terrifying than annihilation is damnation in the life to comemacbeths fall is linked to images of a faded eden he speaks of all that he cannot have honour love obedience troops of friends v iii 25for them the gracious duncan i have murderdput rancours in the vessel of my peaceonly for them and mine eternal jewelgiven to the common enemy of maniii i 65he mentions the loss of his soul the jewel he has tossed away like a careless triflemacbeth can know no pleasure death is not all that awaits macbeth at the end of the play the language reinforces the rhythm of damnation with which macbeths soul has been merging from the first we see lady macbeth in hell we see macbeth on the way in may of 2014 i was fourtunate to be a member of the fredericton high school model united nations team where i represented china on ecosoc at jphmunjphmun included schools from all over new brunswick and pei our team was awarded best deligation the teacher supervisor for our team was mrs mcallister these tweets were retweeted forwarded and widely shared by readers they migrated beyond twitter to blogs tumblr facebook and other sites im told they generated fierce arguments as the days went by the tweets were reproduced in their entirety on the websites of the atlantic and the new york times and they showed up on german spanish and portuguese sites a friend emailed to tell me that the fourth tweet which cheekily namechecks oprah was mentioned on fox televisionthese sentences of mine written without much premeditation had touched a nerve i heard back from many people who were grateful to have read them i heard back from many others who were disappointed or furious many people too many to count called me a racist one person likened me to the mau mau the atlantic writer whod reproduced them while agreeing with my broader points described the language in which they were expressed as resentmentthis weekend i listened to a radio interview given by the pulitzer prizewinning journalist nicholas kristof kristof is best known for his regular column in the new york times in which he often gives accounts of his activism or that of other westerners when i saw the kony 2012 video i found it tonally similar to kristofs approach and that was why i mentioned him in the first of my seven tweets those tweets though unpremeditated were intentional in their irony and seriousness i did not write them to score cheap points much less to hurt anyones feelings i believed that a certain kind of language is too infrequently seen in our public discourse i am a novelist i traffic in subtleties and my goal in writing a novel is to leave the reader not knowing what to think a good novel shouldnt have a pointbut theres a place in the political sphere for direct speech and in the past few years in the us there has been a chilling effect on a certain kind of direct speech pertaining to rights the president is wary of being seen as the angry black man people of color women and gays who now have greater access to the centers of influence that ever before are under pressure to be wellbehaved when talking about their struggles there is an expectation that we can talk about sins but no one must be identified as a sinner newspapers love to describe words or deeds as racially charged even in those cases when it would be more honest to say racist we agree that there is rampant misogyny but misogynists are nowhere to be found homophobia is a problem but no one is homophobic one cumulative effect of this policed language is that when someone dares to point out something as obvious as white privilege it is seen as unduly provocative marginalized voices in america have fewer and fewer avenues to speak plainly about what they suffer the effect of this enforced civility is that those voices are falsified or blocked entirely from the discourseits only in the context of this neutered language that my rather tame tweets can be seen as extreme the interviewer on the radio show i listened to asked kristof if he had heard of me of course he said she asked him what he made of my criticisms his answer was considered and genial but what he said worried me more than an angry outburst would havethere has been a real discomfort and backlash among middleclass educated africans ugandans in particular in this case but people more broadly about having africa as they see it defined by a warlord who does particularly brutal things and about the perception that americans are going to ride in on a white horse and resolve it to me though it seems even more uncomfortable to think that we as white americans should not intervene in a humanitarian disaster because the victims are of a different skin colorhere are some of the middleclass educated africans kristof whether he is familiar with all of them and their work or not chose to take issue with ugandan journalist rosebell kagumire who covered the lords resistance army in 2005 and made an eloquent video response to kony 2012 ugandan scholar mahmood mamdani one of the worlds leading specialists on uganda and the author of a thorough riposte to the political wrongheadedness of invisible children and ethiopianamerican novelist dinaw mengestu who sought out joseph kony met his lieutenants and recently wrote a brilliant essay about how kony 2012 gets the issues wrong they have a different take on what kristof calls a humanitarian disaster and this may be because they see the larger disasters behind it militarization of poorer countries shortsighted agricultural policies resource extraction the propping up of corrupt governments and the astonishing complexity of longrunning violent conflicts over a wide and varied terraini want to tread carefully here i do not accuse kristof of racism nor do i believe he is in any way racist i have no doubt that he has a good heart listening to him on the radio i began to think we could iron the whole thing out over a couple of beers but that precisely is what worries me that is what made me compare american sentimentality to a wounded hippo his good heart does not always allow him to think constellationally he does not connect the dots or see the patterns of power behind the isolated disasters all he sees are hungry mouths and he in his own advocacybyjournalism way is putting food in those mouths as fast as he can all he sees is need and he sees no need to reason out the need for the needbut i disagree with the approach taken by invisible children in particular and by the white savior industrial complex in general because there is much more to doing good work than making a difference there is the principle of first do no harm there is the idea that those who are being helped ought to be consulted over the matters that concern them i write all this from multiple positions i write as an african a black man living in america i am every day subject to the many microaggressions of american racism i also write this as an american enjoying the many privileges that the american passport affords and that residence in this country makes possible i involve myself in this critique of privilege my own privileges of class gender and sexuality are insufficiently examined my cell phone was likely manufactured by poorly treated workers in a chinese factory the coltan in the phone can probably be traced to the conflictriven congo i dont fool myself that i am not implicated in these transnational networks of oppressive practicesand i also write all this as a novelist and storywriter i am sensitive to the power of narratives when jason russell narrator of the kony 2012 video showed his cheerful blonde toddler a photo of joseph kony as the embodiment of evil a glowering dark man and of his friend jacob as the representative of helplessness a sweetfaced african i wondered how russells little boy would develop a nuanced sense of the lives of others particularly others of a different race from his own how would that little boy come to understand that others have autonomy that their right to life is not exclusive of a right to selfrespect in a different context john berger once wrote a singer may be innocent never the song one song we hear too often is the one in which africa serves as a backdrop for white fantasies of conquest and heroism from the colonial project to out of africa to the constant gardener and kony 2012 africa has provided a space onto which white egos can conveniently be projected it is a liberated space in which the usual rules do not apply a nobody from america or europe can go to africa and become a godlike savior or at the very least have his or her emotional needs satisfied many have done it under the banner of making a difference to state this obvious and wellattested truth does not make me a racist or a mau mau it does give me away as an educated middleclass african and i plead guilty as charged it is also worth noting that there are other educated middleclass africans who see this matter differently from me that is what people educated and otherwise do they assess information and sometimes disagree with each otherin any case kristof and i are in profound agreement about one thing there is much happening in many parts of the african continent that is not as it ought to be i have been fortunate in life but that doesnt mean i havent seen or experienced african poverty firsthand i grew up in a land of military coups and economically devastating imfimposed structural adjustment programs the genuine hurt of africa is no fictionand we also agree on something else that there is an internal ethical urge that demands that each of us serve justice as much as he or she can but beyond the immediate attention that he rightly pays hungry mouths child soldiers or raped civilians there are more complex and more widespread problems there are serious problems of governance of infrastructure of democracy and of law and order these problems are neither simple in themselves nor are they reducible to slogans such problems are both intricate and intensely localhow for example could a wellmeaning american help a place like uganda today it begins i believe with some humility with regards to the people in those places it begins with some respect for the agency of the people of uganda in their own lives a great deal of work had been done and continues to be done by ugandans to improve their own country and ignorant comments ive seen many about how we have to save them because they cant save themselves cant change that factlet me draw into this discussion an example from an african country i know very well earlier this year hundreds of thousands of nigerians took to their countrys streets to protest the governments decision to remove a subsidy on petrol this subsidy was widely seen as one of the few blessings of the countrys otherwise catastrophic oil wealth but what made these protests so heartening is that they were about more than the subsidy removal nigeria has one of the most corrupt governments in the world and protesters clearly demanded that something be done about this the protests went on for days at considerable personal risk to the protesters several young people were shot dead and the movement was eventually doused when union leaders capitulated and the army deployed on the streets the movement did not succeed in conventional terms but something important had changed in the political consciousness of the nigerian populace for me and for a number of people i know the protests gave us an opportunity to be proud of nigeria many of us for the first time in our livesthis is not the sort of story that is easy to summarize in an article much less make a viral video about after all there is no simple demand to be made and since corruption is endemic no single villain to topple there is certainly no bridge character kristofs euphemism for white saviors in third world narratives who make the story more palatable to american viewers and yet the story of nigerias protest movement is one of the most important from subsaharan africa so far this year men and women of all classes and ages stood up for what they felt was right they marched peacefully they defended each other and gave each other food and drink christians stood guard while muslims prayed and viceversa and they spoke without fear to their leaders about the kind of country they wanted to see all of it happened with no cool american 20something heroes in sightjoseph kony is no longer in uganda and he is no longer the threat he was but he is a convenient villain for those who need a convenient villain what africa needs more pressingly than konys indictment is more equitable civil society more robust democracy and a fairer system of justice this is the scaffolding from which infrastructure security healthcare and education can be built how do we encourage voices like those of the nigerian masses who marched this january or those who are engaged in the struggle to develop ugandan democracyif americans want to care about africa maybe they should consider evaluating american foreign policy which they already play a direct role in through elections before they impose themselves on africa itself the fact of the matter is that nigeria is one of the top five oil suppliers to the us and american policy is interested first and foremost in the flow of that oil the american government did not see fit to support the nigeria protests though the state department issued a supportive statement our view on that is that the nigerian people have the right to peaceful protest we want to see them protest peacefully and were also urging the nigerian security services to respect the right of popular protest and conduct themselves professionally in dealing with the strikes it reeked of boilerplate rhetoric and unsurprisingly nothing tangible came of it this was as expected under the banner of american interests the oil comes first under that same banner the livelihood of corn farmers in mexico has been destroyed by nafta haitian rice farmers have suffered appalling losses due to haiti being flooded with subsidized american rice a nightmare has been playing out in honduras in the past three years an americanbacked coup and american militarization of that country have contributed to a conflict in which hundreds of activists and journalists have already been murdered the egyptian military which is now suppressing the countrys oncehopeful movement for democracy and killing dozens of activists in the process subsists on 13 billion in annual us aid this is a litany that will be familiar to some to others it will be news but familiar or not it has a bearing on our notions of innocence and our right to helplet us begin our activism right here with the moneydriven villainy at the heart of american foreign policy to do this would be to give up the illusion that the sentimental need to make a difference trumps all other considerations what innocent heroes dont always understand is that they play a useful role for people who have much more cynical motives the white savior industrial complex is a valve for releasing the unbearable pressures that build in a system built on pillage we can participate in the economic destruction of haiti over long years but when the earthquake strikes it feels good to send 10 each to the rescue fund i have no opposition in principle to such donations i frequently make them myself but we must do such things only with awareness of what else is involved if we are going to interfere in the lives of others a little due diligence is a minimum requirementsuccess for kony 2012 would mean increased militarization of the antidemocratic yoweri museveni government which has been in power in uganda since 1986 and has played a major role in the worlds deadliest ongoing conflict the war in the congo but those whom privilege allows to deny constellational thinking would enjoy ignoring this fact there are other troubling connections not least of them being that museveni appears to be a us proxy in its shadowy battles against militants in sudan and especially in somalia who sanctions these conflicts under whose authority and oversight are they conducted who is being killed and whyall of this takes us rather far afield from freshfaced young americans using the power of youtube facebook and pure enthusiasm to change the world a singer may be innocent never

well we havent learned 27 chapters so no 
what is you are mark 
91 
dece 
the exam will be fairly easy i think every thing has been pretty easy up to this point since the whole course is really just transformations of equations logs trig and exponential functions like everything is just transformations of something 
yea the second half is way easier than the first how are you are other classes 
good we havent done anything in english for marks so everyone doesnt have a mark in english yet and midterm report cards are in 2 weeks i have a 92 in world issues and a 89 in chem

ye 
my computer doesnt jhave the port 
no sd port 
nope 
how was you are exam 
good just long 
what was it 
english 
oh cool what u have tomorrow 
world issues 
lol 
what 
i wonder how that willbe 
i dont get it are you hinting that its going to be hard 
her exams are always hard 
you didnt take world issues though r 
i took her other classes 
world issues is different theres not material that she can ask questions about in a similar area or try and word them differently its different 
oh what do u have after 
also the kids in the class are pretty dumb the class average is a 71 chem 
chem exam sucks 
you had a different teacher tho 
yea i dont know just the material is shitty 
yeah thats true 
whats you are application average gonna be 
not sure but im probably only using two of my classes this semester anyway 
what classes 
english and math 
oh what classes from next semester are u gonna use 
psychology bio and physicist i may use chem over physics but it depends 
ye 
ill probably use physics tho 
who is you are physics teacher 
good 
did u get you are marks 
ye 
what are they 
for what 
engineering and math 
88 and 91 engineering is my lowest 
what u get in chem 
90 
nice so u could use that what was you are highest 
i still probably wont use it 91 in math and world issues 
lol nice what is the averge u need 2 get 
89 for physical earth math and computer dice science 
computer dice is a great program so have u updated you are marks on minerva 
lol no the early acceptance round just ended a few days ago so i just need to update them by march or whenever the second round closes 
oh thats different from when i did it 
how 
after exams i submitted my marks 
like the transcript or self report 
self 
hm ill check to see if i can now 
weird 
march 1st and may 2 
must have changed it 
did u have mr cook for any subject 
ya math 
what year 
10th y 
mom and an were figuring out what teachers had chris u and i httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvniauim8cw2ifeatureyoutube 
haha old dopey dunfield i hear they have to replace the foundation of the cafetiere every time he runs in there 
hahahahahahha 
have u heard back from mcgill yet 
no i havent submitted my mid term marks yet 
why not 
we havent got report cards yet 
if i were u i wouldnt wait u can submit the marks u have now 
i dont have any marks 
u have been in you are term for 2 months 
yeah i dont know my overall mark in each class though 
u have to ask the teachers just tell then that u want to check u mark they will do it if you say that u need it for university 
report cards are on wednesday and minerva is down anyway so ill just do it then 
its back up now but yea thats fine then 
the deadline isnt until may 5 or something anyway 
yea i wouldnt wait until then 
why not im going to report them on wednesday but why not 
because the way it works is that they will do you are acceptance right away internet explorer they dont wait for the deadline and then pick so i think the later u apply the hard it becomes to get in 
oh so when i submit them ill hear back within a few days 
no not at all here one second let me check how long it took for me to hear back i cant see where i put my marks in when but it took a while i think like two weeks or something how are you are marks this semester 
good they are a lot better than lasts 
like what 
93 calculus 98 family dynam 97 psych 96 bio 94 physics 
nice yea u can submit those marks if u want to now they cant check you are mark 
yeah but theyre not official 
untill the end of the semester 
i need to wait until the report card 
they dont have to be no they dont ask for it some schools dont have midterm report cards u can just submit 
the marks i submit now are going to be different than the final because of exams and stuff 
yea exactly you submit them now and then send new ones in at the end of the semester 
so i dont need to send a transcript with the midterm 
nope atleast i didnt when i applied it is only at the end of the semester that you have to 
then people could apply and say they have a 99 average and then finish the year with an 80 averge average 
yea i know yea so it doesnt matter how accurate your midterm marks are dont worry if u say they are higher than they are 
yeah but if i say theyre higher then they are and get accepted and they drop then they will revoke the acception 
its has to go down a lot 
like how much 
like mine dropped by 8 or more 
what was it when you applied 
i dont remeber 92 or 95 
dan what exact message came up on minerva when you got accepted did it just say accepted or did it say something else 
i dont know what did they say 2 you 
yeah 
you got in 
yeah 
nice congratz 
i figured it out i just have to send the transcript at the end of the year thanks 
yea thats sweet when did u open it 
about 10 minutes ago 
nice have u told mom and dad yet 
yeah 
nice haave you told chris 
yeah i just texted him 
cool well now you need to find out what courses to take 
yeah mom says i do that near exams also she wants to know when your last exam is 
yeah i finish on the 28th httpswwwmcgillcasciencestudentnewstudentsu0bascfreshmanrequirements here are you are freshman requirments httpsvsbmcgillca use vsb to build you are schedule that first mcgill link is wrong one sec httpswwwmcgillcasciencestudentnewstudentsu0bscfreshmanrequirements take phsyic 101 first semester with me 
yeah i probably will 
do it i need a lab partner 
yeah i will is the physics course your taking phys 101 or phys 131 
101 
haha 
what 
i thought it was 131 the 101 course is just introductory 
yea i know 
like it suggests you take it if you majoring in biologu 
one sec 131 is the same course but it uses calculus 
are you sure the descriptions are different 
yea its just harder what one do u want to do 
i dont know ill probably decide later when im picking im just browsing them for now 
yea every thing i am reading says that 131 is just more rigorous in terms of math i would rather take the easier one because i am taking just to fill a requirement and i dont really care about physics i think u should only take 131 if you are confident in calculus what other classes are u looking at 
yeah im probably going to take 131 because i need it if i want to major in physics or chem but i can still take the other one right now on the vsb i have phys 131 math 140 chem 110 and math 133 
oh really yea u cant take 101 and 131 u have to take only one if you are gonna take 131 then ill take it too it should be pretty easy 
okay the 101 course just sounds like the gr11 curriculum of physics 
haha well you will see that things may sound easy here but everyone is smart here so the test questions are just harder send me a screen shot of you are shcedule 
of the courses or the actual schedule it generates 
the actual schedule 
i still need to add one more course 
you should take a really easy class taking 133 140 and 131 will be kind rough 
where can i find the easy electives 
httpwwwmcgillcastudy20162017courseschem181 
thats winter 2017 also i found them is psyc 100 easy 
i dont think so maybe it is chem 183 is easy history of math is easy 
shouldnt i take something other than a sciencemath for an easy course or am i allowed to if im in science 
you can take anything comp 202 comp 102 
would it make sense choosing a intro history or psych class or something 
comp 189 history classes arent easy here if u want a high mark u are better off taking an easy science 
okay got it so chem of drugs or comp 102 which one easiest 
um chris took chem 183 and got an a so its probably pretty fucking easy 
haha 
also u may want to consider not taking 133 till second semester its a brutal class u may like it tho 
can i take it second 
yea 
okay i need it for chem and physics anyway so ill just take it second should i fill in that course with another easy one or another normal science 
so right now u have 140 110 131 and 183 
yeah 
oh take a bio u have to do that for chem major 
yeah is bio 112 easy never mind bio 112 is only winter 
so are u gonna take 111 there is no rush to do you are bio class first semester if u would rather take 112 you would be better off taking it second semester 
i have to take 112 for chem 111 is not listed there i still need to pick one last course that wont be bio either way 
take comp 202 it is recommended for chem majors and its pretty easy 
comp 202 does not look like an intro course why not comp 102 
102 is a dumb class for arts student i took 202 first semester of first year its easy 
yeah but i have no prior knowledge and u did 
if u have taken comp sci 110 you will be able to do it no proble they assume that u dont know anything about coding its an intro class 
is a 2 class not 1 thats a red flag already 
haha the number system is really arbitrary i took 3 200 level courses my first semester 
doesnt that mean second year 
i actually took 4 200 levels first semester no thats not what it means 100 and 200s are for first years 300s are for second years then the rest is for the last 2 years 
i see alright here is my schedule httpsvsbmcgillcaresultsjspsession2016091codenumberremovecourseviewdetailscourse00math140sa00ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttydropdown00altd001201609course10phys131sa10ttttttttttttttmdropdown10altd100201609course20chem110sa20tttttttttttttttttttttsdropdown20altd200201609course30chem183sa30tmdropdown30altd300201609course40comp202sa40tttkdropdown40sstd401201609camsalltip1pinssfffftimeinclassbbssubmitactionsearch 
nice fucking url haha 
lol also what is lec and tut is lec just lecture 
yea tut is tutorial tut is just the to for the class going over problems kind like a high school class 
oh okay 
yea screen shot you are vsb when u send the url it doesnt show when u picked the classes for 
httpsgyazocom2e2cb0f7438757dbd11b0312c30c9395 
see the arrows at the top 
yeah i understand 
you can cycle through those 
i figured it out yesterday 
why do u want 5 830 classes 
i just screen shot the first one 
oh 
im not going to look throught yet 
yea 
through itll take ages 
try not to take any 830 classes also if u click on the courses at a time u like it fixes it in place with a red push pin

yeah 
how was it 
good good to meet some people in engineering who are actually good people and somewhat similar 
haha yea do u hvae you are frosh group now 
yeah discover mcgill was done in the frosh groups can you send me the download 
httpfacultyccriedujoallenm2990university20physics20with20modern20physics2013th20editionpdf 
thanks 
solve this shit for me also did my solution work for you are cappa 
u forgot to make g negative but i caught it and changed it and it was right also f ftf that is what i think if youve tried ffff and it was wrong then its 100 fftf im sure about 12 and 4 but 3 not so much 
yea i had a f f f f try we will see 
also make sure to read the lab manual because we have 45 minutes to do 4 experiments a lab report so we have to know what were doing 
do we have to do it during lab time 
yeah you have to submit it before 3 hours 
thats fucking dumb 
i know thats why we have to be quick with the experiments was the answer correct 
eyyyy yea it was thanks 
hahano no problem 
have you done the horse one yet 
yep 
is it hard 
ive finished all it not that bad 
kk 
u could probably figure it out by next class 
what was you are answer from 9b 
what q is 9b 
time of bullet 
oh i did dvit12at2 but dlength of woodlength of bullet solve for t using quadratic formula 
oh lol i forgot the bullet 
lol you coming httpsgyazocom8cd64dd3072b85c5bc03bd6dea82d143 couldnt have said it better myself 
haha what the fuck did she make that 
lol no it was generated 
can u solve this for me i cant get it hello 
yeah im at a rez workshop or something its ending in a min 
kk 
380e4 
u sure 
yep tried it 2 ways 
kk ill trust u 
its either that or 375e4 
well what is it 
it depends 
i only have one try left 
im using the acceleration from the question above if u give me the exact accel it will be more accurate 
how can there a difference of 005 
because the accel is only 3 sig figs just give me a min im recalculating 
kk 
yeah its still 380e4 
it was 375 but it was marked right 
are u kidding oh hm interesting 
u up i have capa questions 
ye 
what format did u use for the answser 
haha he talked about notation of degrees in class its deg no symbol 
kk but what was you are value 
for my question 
ye 
the s are different but mine was 158 
to get that did you just use tan1 on the legs of the triangle you used to solve for the hypot also what the fuck is this question about 
hold on im walking back to my dorm haha okay for q7 ysqrt164x d vertical distance so esstially y 49t2 so sqrt164x49t2 x107t so youre left with sqrt164107t49t2 solve for t 
kk thanks i dont get the degrees thing 
did u try deg 
yea 
and it was incorrect 
yea one sec ill give you my x y values x 17645 y 7522 
okay so try tan1176457522 then subtract your answer from 180 nope its tan1752217645 and that should give u the angle 
what about the negative 
doesnt matter 
u sure 
yep 
i get 23deg but that doesnt make sense 
u have to do 18023 
christ i was doing 360 not 180 kk its right what did we do in class today i was at the career fair its for engineers too you should go tomorrow its for engineering too 
lol i know i was going to go this morning but i had so much to do ill go tomorrow and u know the event is called mcgill engineering techfair lol we just stared dynamics and did newtons 3 laws 
okay the tech fair is formal or business casual how does problem 2 work also can u take picture of you are work for problem 4 
for a its just the x distance from the origin an estimate and b is finding the angle once u have the x and y velocities using tan and i dont have the work from 4 but i can show u on wednesday or whenever 
come over tomorrow afternoon 
yeah sure i have a class that ends at 1 
sweet come over then 
mk 
let me know if u get 6 or 9 done

httpwwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid4771881172425seta410048630797321693441157394686type1theater 
sweet 
can you send a picture of the lab sheet i dont currently have one 
kk sec 
hey just want to say that you did a great job with your article its been especially hard nowadays to piece everything from council together 
thanks man sara and holly helped out a lot so that made my life easier 
were doing an article on the mcgill password changing was there anyone in mcgills it that was specifically helpful that you think we should contact 
the people who i spoke to would be an entirely different group of people than the people you will have to talk to likely i suspect that you have to talk to the system administrators 
how did you get their contact infos to begin with 
i talked to doug 
asleep okay facebook deleted my past messages but i keep seeing you everywhere and im sorry it looks like i dont recognize you but im constantly about to fall asleep so im too tired to recognize you until afterwards 
haha yeah when i said hi you looked really confused 
hey 
no it would be easy i also i think that we should 
okay amazing is it something we should work on over the summer or wait until sept 
i mean it will take like 20 minutes just let me know where on the page it should be and how u want it too lookwhat it should say 
okay will do ill ask nick okay noah says he will make sure its included in the new mock up of the home page so i guess i will take my hands off the wheel and let u two brainstorm something design wise 
okay sounds good 
hi i sent a slack message to you and parth a few days about special formatting for an sl piece just wanted to follow up and see if its possible to do some sort of calendar formatting online the article is a list of things to do in montreal so calendar format would be pertinent 
okay yea we can do that when do you have to put it out by 
like end of week theres no real deadline but somewhere around there 
yea sure if u could find an example online that would be good 
okay great looking now thank you daniel okay so the link does a calendar every issue online it looks like this httpsthelinknewspapercacalendar thats more like a list than a calendar but might be the only thing thats feasible but in print it looks like this httpsthelinknewspapercabackissuesreadvolume37issue27 if you go like 5 pages in its on a purple page that says link calendar of events 
okay what kind of functionality do you want like should anything happen when u click an event 
okay i am actually reading the article now and realizing a calendar will not work my bad lol but it is a list maybe we can do something special w list formatting sorry lol 
lol that was easy 
problem solved does wordpress still allow meta sliders im trying to make one for a piece now and having trouble 
i took meta silders down because i was testing something one sec 
ah okay great thank you 
is it working 
lemme try yes it is thank you so much 
no problem 
im doing an article on the new mycourses interface do you perchance know any cs people who are really into talking about interfaces who could give me a quote w their thoughts on it a non tribune person 
lol uh no off the top of my head i cant think on anyone who is really into interfaces we dont really learn about layout in cs 
hey 
hey are you free tomorrow afternoon at 3 for the interview we can just do it on facebook 
works for me 
great talk to you then hey ready to start 
sorry running a bit late should be ready in a few minutes 
okay no problem 
okay ready to go 
great okay just to start what is your major and what year are you internet explorer u0 u1 u2 u3 
im in software engineering and u3 
okay so can you just tell me about the extension you just describe its functionality 
basically it adds a bunch of features to the mcgill site that i though would improve how easily students are find what they want when you are on the overview page for a course it lets you jump to a different years version of the page access the vsb listings for that course the minerva registration page for that course or access mercury evaluations for an instructor as well as a lot of other things 
cool i love the extension by the way started using it fall semester of 2016 how long did it take you to develop and are you still putting out updates 
thanks its been an ongoing project over the past two years and im still updating it and adding functionality 
so roughly how many hours have you put into the project thus far 
haha difficult to determine at this point but id say at least a couple of hundred hours when i started it i had almost no web development experience but i really wanted to fix some of the things that frustrated me about the site its been a great learning experience 
thats a great segway into my next question i know you mentioned wanting to practice your web development skills but what was it specifically about the websites that you found hard to usefrustrating 
what biggest thing that frustrated me was searching google for a course and ending up on a course overview page but from a previous year the mcgill site would have a message that showed i was on a previous year and the options it provided were either to click a link that brings you to the home page of the current year or edit the year in the url yourself to get to the current years version of the course page i realized that instead of editing the url myself everytime i could write a script that does that for you generally the mcgill site isnt terrible but i think there are some issues with how easy it is to navigate through the site the fact that its a large site and the ui isnt always consistent makes this worse as well as how well mcgill integrates their different systems 
i am hearing that same complaints from a lot of students its cool that you did something about it do you know how many people have downloaded your extension also is it available for browsers other than chrome 
right now there are over 900 people using the chrome extension and ive ported it to firefox but havent published it for that browser yet coming soon though and yeah the silver lining is that problems motivate people to solve them i think vsb itself was originally a student run project and i know of other mcgill students who have developed tools to improve things zafarali ahmeds minerva bot is a very cool example 
yea the minerva bot is cool as hell do you think there are any negative effects on mcgill having a web infrastructure like this in terms of the image mcgill puts out into the world or other concerns 
im not sure how much it affects mcgills image since a lot of the issues might not necessarily be apparent to people who arent interacting with on a daily basis and im sure there are plenty of universities that are much further behind for me he larger issue seems to be how it affects students when you want to register for course you shouldnt have to look up course info on the overview page then navigate through minerva to search for mercury evaluations then go to vsb for schedules and then go back to minerva and navigate to the registration menu to submit course codes being able to jump straight from a course overview page to the registration page or mercury evaluations for that course or being able to register straight from vsb without copying and pasting  codes makes the process a lot smoother and thats what i tried to accomplish with my extension 
very true alright those are all the questions i have you thanks for taking time to speak with me demetrios i will send you a link the to the article when it is published 
no problem i appreciate it 
one last thing do you think that zafarali ahmed would also be interested in an interview 
probably definitely ask him is think his input would be really valuable 
okay great thanks again hey here is the article httpwwwmcgilltribunecomdeadlinkshope you get some more users as a result

so do you think you will get to go 
and they kind of choose whos going to go and where theyre going to hope so 
where i am there are usually not enough kids to fill spots 
oh i thinj that never happened in here think so did you actually picked to go to our youth meeting 
haha no we only pick for our seminars 
ooh but what happens if more then one person want the same country 
then they take names from a hat 
haha as simple as that i wish it was like this in here were in like 25 persons for i dont know 15 places 
is it political there 
political what do you mean

oh vancouver really thats awesome how was the meeting and why was it weird to see jared haha i talked to him and he said he might be a junior councillpr in july 
the meeting were long it was weird to see jared because it seem sometimes like the cisv world and the real world are two different places so it was weird to see some one from the cisv world in the real world but it was a good kind of weird 
haha got it soon were having this njbt is that the name thing but im not even on junior board shame on me

whaaat dont you feel like a baby driving haha i mean everytime i think about me as driver i feel so small to be a driver haha 
haha feel like a baby me no i am kinda scared and it makes sense for you to be scared your part asian so being a bad driver is in your blood 
haha you know we had to be bad at something but maybe i feel like a baby cause here we can only drive with 18 so for me its like an adult thing haha 
18 you will feel like an old lady by then so you are 18 can you drive 
haha i can take my licence but i think ill only do it by february after holidays cause you have to take a lot of classes and the do the practical exam 
is driving suppose to be harder in brazil in canada we just read a little book and take a quiz 
really i bet youre the worst drivers i dont know why its so hard in here and believe it or not even though there so many bad drivers 
i think there are bad drivers in every country there are asians in ever country

ah winter you should really experience a canadian winter it was snowing last week 
and we move it backward for the summer really i think i only saw snow once haha so beautiful 
haha did you touch it or just see it 
both haha it was not once actually it was like a fez times in the same trip but i was 9 or 10 i guess few in argentina but i gotta say it was a little bit frustrating when i tried to do a snow man it seems so easy 
haha once at a mini camp there were these kids to had just imigrated from bhutan and had never seen snow before and when we were all there i started snowing it was so cute to see them see snow for the first time 
ounnn i can imagine it hm i might go to bed now enjoy the snow for me i mean it

i am sorry to hear that you werent acceptedthe university obviously doesnt know what they are doing if they didnt pick you p i hope you enjoy your summer here in fredericton we are getting a storm on the 27 so hopefully it wont travel to brazil in one day 
haha im gonna trust you enjoy your storm and why my summer is summer huh its so so so hot in here im getting crazyyy and what about you arent you traveling to the new years eve 
i am going to see my family in another city so i guess that is exciting and your summer is summer because brazil just wants to be different for the real world it is winter 
h so below the equator is not real world very intresting very intresting i think someone is getting tired of snow and wanted to be sunbathing over here with me 
you saw riight through my lies so much snow and so little sun i need to get my tan on 
haha ill take it for you trust me i beeet you are one of those people who stay five minutes in the sun and already look like a pepper 
funny you should say that here is a picture of me on the beach 
hahahahahahahaha youre such a begginer if the rain over here alowed me ill show you how a real tan looks like 
i would like too see that you will be more red than me dont forget what happens when you drink beer 
ooohh that was low haha but i bet if you were here youd be even reder than me after some beers dont you underestimate a brazilian summer 
i think i could handle a little rain and clouds httpwwwtheweathernetworkcomweatherbrxx0232 
i cant see it cause im on my phone mimimi ill see it later but hey happy new year this year will be even better than last year but not as good as next year haha how was your nightt

hm a lot of plans but nothing really concrete haha as always but around the 20th ill have my graduation triap haha i dont know if you call it this way haha but im exciteeed what about you are you building snow men and doing snow balls wars haha 
haha i think that i will try to avoid the snow as much as possible its not as magical as it use to be where is are you going for your graduation trip 
no how dare you say youre trying to avoid the snow think of us poor tropical countrys who dont have snow since ever 
every teenagers dreamhuh well not mine no how dare you say you want to avoid the beach think of us poor snow covered countrys who dont have beaches sinceever shame on you yumy pompeia does that sound familiar ahahaaahha 
haha fair enough enjoy the snow that ill enjoy the beach and you do have beaches so your argument is invalid ouch haha just kiddinnng 3 
oh how cute you can use words bigger than 6 letters invalid argument so impressed 
and you keep underestimating me i can even say words with 45 letters okay wanna see it pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis

haha prison break only 14 year old boys like that show i have heard that a clockwork orange is fucked up as for me i have my exams in a week so i am stressing hardcore but once i am done i will be free for 3 days then my next half of the year starts 
oh im sorry for you but those 3 days of freedom will be the best im sureand about those 14 year old boys who like prision break they certainly have really developed minds and also a very good taste and you should start whatching it so you can see for yourself how good it is haha

i went skiing with my friends yet another thing you cant do in brazil and then ate cake 
hm it seems good to meand here we have what we call ass ski haha which is in the dunes you can also snowboard but i dont have de capacity it is something like that httpwwwkariribeachhotelcombrnovophotosskibundaskibunda01jpg 
that is pretty bad ass but speaking of ass skiing we do that too in canada this is a video from a street in montreal yesterday skip to 31 seconds httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvnjg3a5fxo0o 
haha what the fuck is it a flood thats closer to a water slide we can do that on little waterfalls not in the middle of the street you crazy nothern people 
yumy you are making me jealous i see all of your summer time photos on my news feed meanwhile it snow 30cm here today save me 
haha what i can say come to the best country in the world im waiting for you over here 
if you want to buy me a ticket so what new and exciting things are happening in your life 
haha sure your tickets are on its wayand new and exciting hm not much right now i went to a friends farm on the carnival and it was really great and im finally taking my drive lessons and it totally sucks what about you do you guys celebrate the carnival 
we celebrate winter carnival which is where little kids go sliding in the snow and drink hot chocolate as for me all i am doing is going to school but next week we have a mini vacation for one week and my brother is coming home from university so something to look forward too 
haha besides school it seems great to me im still in vacation for another 2 weeks but thats not normal at all all the schools already started like a month ago but my preparation for university only starts on the march 7th 
preparation for university what is that 
haha we dont call it exactly preparation for university but thats what it is its what you do if youve finnished school and have not entered yet into the university you want so its like school but specifically to the universitys test dont you guys have anything like that 
haha no in canaada you can get into most universities as long as you have a 85 average you dont have to take any test when you finish high school they just take your marks from the classes you take and use that 
hm im not sure what is better cause imagine if you have any kind of problem in the middle of your high school than that might compromise your entire academic life but that test we have over here is not at all better the questions are so specific and theres a looot of pressure 
either way school sucks i just want to run into the woods and live there rest on my life

those are the ones i missed on the red carpet what was i thinking 
their hair is nicer than the actresses bad move 
haha bad bad move anne hathaway will won this one i guesa 
haha too bad but yes all of the others were just okay you got it 
uhumm i really liked leonardo did caprio in django is he even a nominee 
no but he really should have been 
yeess hes such a good actor and have never won an oscar 
really thats crazy he is so good maybe the academy are jealous 
haha i think so too 
so many old white men 
haha yes whos that presenter i dont know him 
he is the president of the academy 
hm how i dont know himm durd seriously have you ever seen him before 
he looks familiar hm ill check 
the soundtrack of django is awesomeee it should win although i like adele 
yea django had a great sound track but adele wasnt in skyfall much django better win so i saw on my newsfeed a picture of you smoking bad yumy 
ouch but i dont smoke only onnnce in a while when im drunk and want to feel more adult its weird 
haha feel more adult so i must ask do you smoke weed 
soometimes not often what about you 
every once and a while when my brother is home i smoke much more he smokes a lot 
weed right or cigaretes you smoke with your brother isnt it weird 
haha yea weed and its not weird its like family bonding have u ever smoked with your brother 
no and it would be weird im sure 
haha but why 
i dont know haha but it would we dont do that kind of things together and im not even sure if he smokes 
you have never asked him haha he must dont most people smoke weed in brazil 
no haha and i dont know if a lot of people most dont 
wow so that makes you a bad kid then 
haha no it is normal a lot of people smoke but a lot dont now even more people starts smoking 
what would your parents do if they found out 
hm im really not sure my mother would have a loooong converstion and my dad i really dont know he told me once that he used to smoke qhen he was young what about yours 
they have never talked about it but i think they may just ignore it and pretend it didnt happen they dont like having serious talks about stuff 
really but do you think its better 
hm if i had kids i wouldnt handle it like that it is just like the elephant in the room 
elephant in the room 
like something no one wants to talk about but they all know it happened 
yes i agree with you i hate to have those talks but i think theyre necessary 
i think if i had those talks i would be closer to my parents 
yes probably but you still can always have those conversations haha 
haha ask them to have the conversation 
yeep i dont know maybe just bring the subject and see what happens sometimes we have to be the parents haha 
haha that sounds like something oprah would say 
haha oprah is awesome 
haha do you watch her 
actually no i think ive never watched an entire show 
haha tarantino just won 
yeeeeey haha its only his second oscar i thought he had won more 
me too he is so awkward peace out haha so bad 
haha coming from tarantino a lot of things get weird 
haahahahah i guess true artists are always a little weird 
yeah but an intrest kind of weirdness ang lee is also great 
haha yes wow that was a fast response to his win 
on carnival ive watched for the first time brokeback mountain its really good 
really i have always wanted to watch it but i dont know who to watch it with a boy kinda weird or a girl also kinda weird 
haha and alone maybe even weirdest 
haha i guess i will watch it with my cat or maybe thats wierd too oh 
haaaahahahahaha no the cat is the best option 
but its a boy cat hm still the best option 
i think so comparing to the others maybe a dog 
but i dont own a dog so do i have to go find one just to see the movie oh my so much work 
haha just be a man and watch it 
haha fine if it was really that good 
its good cause is different from what were used to 
ye thats truee are u still watching the oscars 
yes arent you 
yes i hope phoenix wins in this category 
phoenix 
joaquin phoenix

really thats awesome 
yes but not for the reasons theyre doing it 
haha yeah iran is such crazy country 
yeah but the usa are no better 
true lots of fucked up countries 
i know right 
good thing brazil and canada a some what normal 
haha totally were great 
haha we s0 arre 
haha but sometimes i think im a little bit anti american 
thats a good thing it balances out all the people who love america 
haha maybe theyre so nationalists arent they 
i like the people but not the place 
ive never been there and the people i know i like but ai usually think that i wont like the people too 
i live like 1 hour away from usa so i go there sometimes and you can see it even in the north like they love their country and their guns so much 
haha i hate thaat do you live near which state 
maine its kinda similar to my province new brunswick but the deeper you go the worse it gets 
haha on my village there was a junior councillpr from maine 
haha mine too 
i still have a tiara with lobster claws 
hahahahahahahahah thats so funny 
haha its a great tiara 
i am just imagining it on you wow so beautiful 
yes i send you a picture some other time 
haha yes but be careful i am allergic o 
really what happens if you eat it 
i dont i never have they just sad i am allergic so i have never tried it but my mom is also allergic to it and she ate it once and was sick for like a week 
really youve never tried you dont know how it tastes that must be weird actually im not sure i know how it tastes haha 
haha its weird because i live near a place were lobster is a big deal and when i go there it is kinda weird 
haha i can imagine but can you eat shripms 
no 
and never tried haha if its any consolation i dont like very much seafood 
that makes me feel better 
hey dont you have school tomorrow 
haha yes but no tests so i will sleep in math 
good choice good choice but there its like 135 
haha yes the night is young 
haha sure it is here is already 2 
really but u can sleep till like 3 pm 
no i cant cause i have drive lessons yes at 1330 but even thoug 
oh wow so grown up 
haha i know do you alrready took yours 
kinda i have it but i can only drive when i have a person in the car with me who has a drivers license 
oh but thats already something when will you be able to drive alone 
june 0 you 
im not sure but not soon i still have 7 teoric classes to go and after that i have to make a test and if i pass ill have to make 20 hours of pratic classes then a pratic exam annd if i pass ill finally will drive 
haha holy shit thats so much stuff to do 
tell me about it 
haha do you get your own car when you finish 
haha i dont think my parents will give me one as easy as that 
haha i feel you are pain my friends get cars but not me 
but ill be that kind of person who can drive but often prefer to take the bus 
haha but arent busses dangerous in brazil 
haha its kind of hard to explain i guess cause its other reallity if by dangerous you mean that i can be robbed its dangerous but i take the bus all the time and have never been 
what do u mean 
that i dont think its dangerous but you might cause youre not used to it 
ye but doesnt that scare you that it could happen 
it always could happen anywhere thats the point haha you just have to be minimally carefull 
like what do you have to do 
in theory you have to be always alert and basically thats it the only thing i actually do is avoid empty places and streets i mean empty streets 
well thatt makes sense i am going to bed school tomorrow sweet dreams 
you too good school tomorrow y

yeah the question really is if military action is the right path 
that too and it sucks because that seems like the only way to get this guy too 
yeah i think it good that people care so much but it seem like they are jumping on the bandwagon without doig much research at all 
they are and it kinda makes me mad to see from both view points 
yeah i find some people really dump on the whole idea but theres notmuch you can doo 
me and a friend of mine has to bash on this dude in class today he was saying that we have more important things like our economy to worry about which i would understand if the issue of human life wasnt what were talking about to me everyone who says that has their values totally backwards 
yeah thats a really upsetting thing to hear but at the same time that is what the politicians focus on 
what have people up north said 
generally the same lots of love lots of hate 
well i guess well see what happens hey is jean really coming over there this summer 
yeah i think so im not sure

but that could lead o my death and that would be a tragedy the world would not overcome 
would it 
yes yes it would just as the death of chester would lead to a celebration 
now that is something i cant argue with 
haha but then the religion chesterism would die and my hitstory class might actually be productive and apparently we cant have that 
haha 
ive been wondering why exactly did your group dislike your book club novel 
wasnt a good book

she is pretty dull 
dull

dumb as a wall 
lets not insult walls 
r u der 
not 7 hours ago 
what is the deal for assembly 
good question 
how much coffee do we want and if we get it donated do we want it brewed for usu get my gift yet 
what what what i dont know on the coffee ask neville tomorrow brewed should be yes and what 
ill take that as a no 
yes 
can you send me the marxist critical theory hand out 
here you go one day 
i am having trouble rendering the avchd video any tips 
specific error imovie was fine and you have the right files 
the issue is when i render it outputs the audio but only still images from the video 
okay i dont think thats an avchd thing what format does my camera output in mov 
what do we need to write for the body paragraphs 
well uh body paragraphs she didnt give us any notes on them 
just general paragraphs 
yeah explain your topic sentences remember how i discouraged you from the t4i at this price i reccommend ithttpwwwfutureshopcaencaproductcanoncanonrebelt4i18mpdslrcamerawith1855mmf3556isiilenskiteost4i185510195080aspxpath7481175172c2ba60dcaf8e98d6f2d3bden02 and futureshops going insane on dslrs overall so i encourage you to take a look 
not worth the extra 100 for anice interface 
yeah but you still get some processing upgrades and stuff its worth itthat being said t3i is still excellent and saving a hundred bucks never hurt anyone 
then i can buy a 50mm lens 
yes thats a good idea those may be on sale too

worng dateeeee also 79 
i so its the 28 
yessireebob i assume you can change that easily same with time 
i didnt it in paint so no loljk yeha i can change it easy 
actually i merged all the layers for fun and deleted the version with layers 
hur 
jaime now do you think that one type is the best way to go or should i go for multiple types and since youre my campaign manager now surprise i need some help on my speech what do you think i should cover 
the speech should cover events how you plan on making the src more inclusive and why you are the man to do the job but most of all jokes lots of jokes 
yes sir okay what do you think of these ill need a current picture of me in a suit and i dont know what to say in the words area 
lol a little cliche i like the first one best 
haha well i was working on this idea and i have this this is the colour and photo id like to use but i dont know what words to put under i have three words that aare serious leadership hope and progress or i could go with three joke works 
you could do 2 serious and a joke 
think thatll go best 
i guess by doing that it makes the whole thing a joke 
well a lot of people like the idea of jokes jakob said the serious campaign was too heavy 
most people dont care about the issues you have just got to make them lol 
so any ideas on what words to use oikay i need some posters for tomorrow so if you can finish some tonight by 8 or so id like to get them printed i upped the resolution on the text ones so they look a lot nicer now i may have lost the cafeteria but cyberspace is mine 
lol i dont find annas posters stand out you need the text ones 
oh god annas posters she ripped off a bunch from last year and people are mad 
haha really whos 
nevilles harry potter kianas keep calm and carry on nike references and some bloody smiley face also i found this program that ups photo resolution and its really good anyway im thinking maybe 40 text 20 ones with your image saying hope leadership gorgeous and 10 of latin american style ones 
that sounds good chunks of text are key 
yeah i have some really lightweight ones too just gonna mass print these dirt cheap and put em everywhere 
coverthenight 
fucking connie 
what 
compare his fucking status to my pages status 
same format lol 
three fucking points the same and he nearly copied his last line word for word from me 
no one likes a copycat 
how do we make everyone fucking know he is 
we cant 
damn 
can you film after school friday 
we have an src meeting after that probably 
sounds good we can shoot jacks then too 
perfect his cover is copying my obama theme daniel 
lol talk to him tomorrow about it see what he says 
you in montreal right now 
yea y 
just curious you saw my video right 
ya are you happy with it 
thought it was great what did you think 
serious 
not good 
it was good just different from anna 
i feel thats good for me i liked it but i dont know if other students will 
as long as the speech is funny it will be a diverse campaign 
i finished my speech actually you wanna read it 
ill give it a read and talk it over with my brother send it my way 
thanks man 
my brother says avoid using i and me also take the microphone off the stand when you speak 
like remove them completely and yeah ill be sure to that wasnt great today was it 
what the hell do you mean people loved it 
aye 
i thought it went really well far better than annas 
okay well thats good then 
did you get a chance to vote 
i did indeed 
well who do you think will win vice president 
i voted jack of course and the race is between him and dorkus 
you think no matter who wins i will be surprised 
not surprised you mean i actually have no clue thinking back on it they all did okay speeches and all have a good chunk of hardcore support 
i think it may go to dorcus 
yeah possibly you are disgusting 
dad that you 
just saying just saying hey do you think you can figure out which font i could use to parody this httpreadvertisingblogfileswordpresscom201105printrolexpng 
i have no idea

okay anything in particular u want it to say 
cant say there is its valedictorian i cant imagine i need it to say too much right 
should it say vote seshu for valedictorian also do u want a new photo for the poster

lol u dere 
from the black screen we hear a sweeping orchestral melody intimate and moving smash cut toext town from the top of the wall nightspringtime is in the air on this particular night you can see that as clear as anything else in this seemingly picturesque town a charmingly quaint town square contains a town hall general store school house and doctors office with a fountain in the centre of them behind the general store that stands to the north of the fountain there is a line of elm trees that shadow a large garden behind itthe camera cuts from the square to the row of trees it moves along them in a sweeping motion it looks as if you could just reach out and touch the leaves the camera then cuts to a row of wellappointed suburban houses moving in the same fashion as the shot along the trees the only thing that seems out of the ordinary is a lack of any vehicles or driveways attached to these houses in fact there are no roads at all just wide sidewalks and bike paths that connect the houses when the shot comes to the end of the street the camera pans upwards to reveala massive 30foot granite wall that stretches behind the houses and across the entire shot the camera then cuts again moving along the wall in the same fluid motion the wall is shot in an intimate way revealing all of the little cracks and imperfections along its coarse surface it cuts again from the bottom of the wall looking directly up its surface and into the sky then from the top of the wall looking down on the little houses and the treelined sidewalks the camera pans right 90 degrees and its revealed that the wall encloses the entire town in one giant rectangle all of the residents of the town have their entire lives enclosed within those walls and thats how its been as far back as anyone can remember the thought of breaching the wall somehow or what lies on the other side is one that hasnt occurred to anybody yet the shot then moves slowly from the top of the wall and back down to earth it is here that we first see our protagonist sterling kimper19 walking lazily along the sidewalk with his hands in his jacket pockets kimp as his friends call him is a dreamer someone who doesnt live entirely within this world but as certain social and societal pressures begin to weigh down upon him more and more he begins to get wistful he longs for something that he cannot put his finger down on yet on his walk kimp notices the soft sound of classical music the same that has been playing since the beginning wafting out of the house to his left he pauses a moment and looks to the house he sees a giant picture window facing the street soft yellow light like the kind that comes from a christmas tree pours out of the window then a lone dancer dressed in traditional ballet regalia dance shoes with ribbons tied up the legs hair pulled back into a bun dances into the natural frame set by the window her porcelain skin gleams in the light and her body contorts itself in flowing motions to the tempo and melody of the music she drifts in and out of the window as if on a cloud kimp takes all of this in and gives a slight sigh taking in the beauty of the situation he watches for a moment more and then walks on the camera follows him from behind looking over him with his head in the center of the shot kimp arrives at a front porch ext outside of the sanford house moments lateralthough all the houses we have seen thus far are quite nice this one is particularly beautiful that is because it belongs to the mayor of town peter sanford43 a long time incumbent peter is slowly beginning to lose the once firm grasp he had on the peoples favours due to recent violent uprisings in the poor part of town the way the town is laid out the richest families live in the houses closest to the town square and the poorest live farthest away despite his lack of political savvy peter is an affable person a good neighbour and a fundamentally wellintentioned person it isnt peter that kimp is here to see however it is his son casper sanford19 kimps longtime best friend whos in the midst of throwing a party kimp walks up the steps of the front porch and rings the doorbell a few beats go by and the door swings open music fractures in plaster superchunkcasper walks into the frame of the door and sees that its kimp his eyes light up casperkimp i knew you would come how are ya buddycasper clasps kimps shoulder and guides him inside int caspers house moments laterkimpoh you know same old same old casper brings kimp into the living room that is attached to the kitchen the shot follows the pair through the house and we see what the party looks like there are dozens of people crowded in all the crevices of the house people talk loudly to one another trying to speak over the din of the music and drink from red plastic cups couples make out on couches and in the corners of the living room kimp takes all this in and you can tell that he feels at least a little out of place kimp contdwow there sure are a lot of people here casperrhetoricallyi know isnt it great they end up in the kitchen where a large keg sits in an even bigger bucket of ice marble counter tops line the walls and are crowded with stacks of plastic cups and bottles of clear liquid in glass bottles people play quarters at the kitchen table kimp grabs a cup off of the counter and moves over to the keg as he chats with casper kimphow are things wit youcaspertheyve been better my dads been driving all of us nuts trying to fix the whole problem on the other end of town hes locked himself in his room trying to think of something now kimpaw thats too bad make sure to not let him near hannah tonight ehcasperyeah i caught her a few times trying to walk upstairs kimpif she ever got a hold of him shed be liable to shout his head off or somethingcasperi almost didnt invite her for precisely that reason they both laugh the doorbell ringscasper contdi gotta go get thatcasper walks out of the kitchen and the shot stays on kimp in the kitchen he finishes filling his cup and walks into the living room where he spots the aforementioned hannah peterson 18 trying to walk upstairsshe is a strong willed strong minded outspoken person this is likely due to her mother joanna doc phillips the town doctor although the position of town doctor is a highly coveted well paying job doc moved her family of hannah and her siblings to the poor part of town to protest the inaction of the mayor and help any victims of the riots her main office is located in the town square but ever since moving she began to work mainly out of her house this has cut down the number of riotrelated fatalities down quite a bit but has also angered the upper and middle class members of the town who dont like to venture from their safe comfortable homes and confront the malaise that has plagued their fellow townsmen kimp runs over to hannah to stop her he gently grabs her arm she turns around and notices who it is they both begin to talk on the stairs kimphi hannah hannahhello kimp you can let go of my arm now kimpi dont think casper wants you going up there hannahso whats it to you i just want to talk to his dad for a bit kimpi think we both know how thatll turn out hannahdo we nowkimpyeahhannahokay tell me thenkimppardonhannahplayfullytell me what ill do if you know me so well kimpalright fine youll go up there and knock on his door all calm and collected at first youll be polite and say something like mr sanford sir may i talk to you for a moment then the second he lets you in youll go on a tirade about how unfair the whole economic system is and how the town isnt giving enough infrastructure support how there arent enough jobs you wont let him get a word in edgewise then when youre finished and all out of breath youll look up and see that hes weeping just like that time you yelled at him at the last town hall meeting and he ran offstage crying hell agree with everything you say but wont be able to do anything about it then nothing will change hannahwell of course nothing will change if you have that attitude kimp knows that shes baiting him but he goes in anywaykimpokay thats true but look at the finances theres simply not enough money to do everything you think we need to hannahbut there is enough money to give free electricity to everybody within walking distance of the general store and why is it exactly that everyone on your side get all the jobs while those on my side get squatkimpi know i know weve had this argument a thousand times and im sure youve had it millions of times with just about everyone in town hannahinterruptingyour point beingkimpmy point being that all this talk hasnt really gotten you anywhere has it i mean you keep on treading over the same old ground while things just get worse and worse isnt it time to take actionhannahand what do you suggest i do huh steal from the rich kill the mayorkimpgeez hannah you shouldnt say things like thathannahwhy i hear it all the time around my neighbourhood maybe we need some sort of shake up in the systemkimplaughsjust dont let casper hear you say that the camera does a dramatic pull in on hannahs face the rest of the party seems to get really quiet even though nothing has changed for the rest of the conversation the camera remains on hannah hannahim telling you kimp things are gonna change one way or another kimpoh yeah what makes you so surehannahnature has a way of sorting everything out when life becomes stagnant its simple science if an ice cube sits out in the sun too long it melts if a mouse sits in one spot for too long a cat will snatch it up besides i can feel it coming like theres a certain energy in the air cant you feel it toothe camera stays on hannah for a few more secondscut tomain title sequence also ive considered your criticisms of the main plot point and decided that theyre valid im probably going to change it to where yes they have thought of the idea of whats on the other side of the wall and yes its been brought up before but people didnt try to find out due to lack of resourcesfear of whats on the other side now kimp sees this girl and brings up the issue at a town hall meeting and people get all up in arms about it they take sides and any feud that was bubbling up between the rich and the poor gets calcified sound better 
tldr 
what a dick casperhey you made it come on incasper clasps kimps shoulder and guides him inside int caspers house seconds latercasper brings kimp into the living room that is attached to the kitchen the shot follows the pair through the house and we see what the party looks like there are dozens of people crowded in all the crevices of the house people talk loudly to one another trying to speak over the din of the music and drink from red plastic cups couples make out on couches and in the corners of the living room kimp takes all this in and you can tell that he feels at least a little out of place kimpjesus there are a lot of people here casperi know isnt it great they end up in the kitchen where a large keg sits in an even bigger bucket of ice marble counter tops line the walls and are crowded with stacks of plastic cups and bottles of clear liquid in glass bottles people play quarters at the kitchen table kimp grabs a cup off of the counter and moves over to the keg as he chats with casper kimpno not really how do you expect me to mingle with all these idiots i mean im going to have to sit in a corner and make snarky comments to myself if i want to survive the night without having my iq lowered fifty pointscaspermockingkimp shut the hell up kimpim sorry but its true now i know that this is the company that youre keeping these days so ill try to be nice ill even mingle if i dont have to talk to them for too long casperive got a better idea hannah got here a littlekimps eyes light upkimphannahs herecasper while ago and you can tell that shes looking for a fightkimpand suddenly the evening takes a turn for the interesting casperyeah youre welcome listen though if you see her try to go upstairs stop her my dads up there driving himself crazy about the conference tomorrow and i dont want a repeat of the last town hall kimpoh come on she was being completely reasonablecaspershe made him break down into tears

awesome new villian for season five 
rap group most mef 
june 1st 2010to the src selection committee first a little bit of info about me i am a sixteen year old grade ten student at fhs i enjoy almost all types of physical activates such as running skiing biking and hockey my other interests include writing reading listening to music and watching movies to name a few academically my grades are in the high 80s and low 90s recently i have been looking to get more involved in events at the school which is why im applying for a 201011 src executive positiona few years ago i volunteered in the kitchen of a summer camp for several weeks while i was there i learned many of the ins and outs of working as team as well as what it takes to accomplish goals within a group first and foremost it cant be all about you its give and take whether its working organizing or sharing ideas this knowledge is just a part of why i think that i would make a very valuable addition to the team that is the fhs student representative councilanother thing i would bring to the table are my excellent organizational and time management skills i tend to plan everything in my life be it school projects or personal goals or upcoming events on my social calendar it is my opinion that it is never too early to begin the planning process that way there is more time to determine exactly what needs to be done and when it also allows time to develop solutions for problems that might arise in order to be ready for anything should a problem occur i believe that i have a very strong work ethic when i am asked to do something i tend to do it right away without giving in to minor distractions or interruptions that way the work can be done in a straightforward and timely fashion additionally when doing my work i try to visualize the finished product or the big picture i find that visualization has a big role in maintaining focus through all stages of a project examples of my work ethic are evident in my ability to keep my academic average in the 90s while also working a job at tim hortons but why exactly do i want to be on the src i believe in making a positive contribution to our schools community i also believe that the src would be the best way of making that contribution ive heard descriptions of the position from current and former src executives almost all of the things that theyve mentioned apply directly to my skill set the job as i understand is very hard work but i believe that i possess the drive that it takes to get the job done effectively and efficiently i hope you feel the same wayregards chris lutes hai mark what events are you going to produce

i dunno we were gonna call today but then jorya had to go to ikea to buy curtains for the apartment so well call tomorrow and hopefully itll be set up by friday album review sheryl crow feels like homechris lutessince sheryl crow debuted in the mid 90s shes tried on a number of different personas from earnestly personal to politically charged to now folksy country its this guise that she wears in her new album feels like home the subject matter checks most of the boxes for country passionate flings callin me when im lonely casual alcoholism we oughta be drinking and the allure of the open road shotgun but fails to say anything interesting or original about them at times it feels like literally every line is a clich nothing on the album is worse than the cringeworthy line thank god they make waterproof mascara because it wont run like his daddy did thankfully some tracks are much more grounded than that namely with the onetwo gut punch of homesick and homecoming queen two brutal emotionally honest tracks about lost love and the compromise that comes with fading glory here the ostentatious noise of the rest of the album gets stripped away in favour of something more personal and real its too bad that the same cant be said of the rest of the album which is overproduced in the most inoffensively bland radiofriendly way possible the saccharine arrangements torpedo any nuance that manages to shine through however the good far outweighs the bad on the closing track stay at home mother which crow whispers through to hauntingly beautiful effect its a shame that the album as a whole cant rise above these few isolated moments of greatness how was your test 
it went kinda well i finished so thats good 
thats good did you see breaking bad 
fuck yea 
pretty good eh

so fucking good oscar material maybe 
shit son but i got a movie that can beat it httpthepiratebaysetorrent9440136shortterm122013limiteddvdripx264amiable 
holy fuck so fucking good wow ahhhhhhhhhh 
did you actually watch it 
yea 
yeah i thought it was fantastic 
hows it rank in movies of the year 
top five for sure probably 2 or 3 you 
whats one 
inside llewyn david davis 
and its probably a one for me or maybe 2 whats you are list 
what would one be 
maybe american hustle but probz not 
hang on ill send it to you httpwwwimdbcomlistxmba9mrnl08 
httpimgurcom3fymxu8 also america hustle is better than francis ha 
haha that turned out pretty good and nope it isnt also you fell asleep like five minutes into frances ha 
i went back and watched it this weekend not so good 
serious what didnt you like 
lack plot could not relate to charectors 
neither of those are actual criticisms 
lack of plot is 
fair enough but i dont know how legitimate it is in the case of frances ha the plot is that she doesnt have any money or a place to live so she goes from couch to couch alienating the people around her until she finally learns to be an adult 
does she tho not really i mean i guess 
she gets a respectable job and her own place 
you explaining the plot of a movie doesnt make it good tho 
well no shit if i explained the plot of transformers 2 revenge of the fallen it wouldnt become a good movie 
haha frances ha also had shit acting 
what by who 
frances 
are you shitting me 
she fucking sucks 
thats as close to objectively untrue as you can get with something like this 
nooooooooooooo jared and shawn would agree 
haha okay 
also girl from justified was in short term 12 i knew i knew her from somewhere 
i know i really wanted her to play loretta she already comes from a troubled past 
haha 
and the ending could have been raylan givens shooting her dad in the head 
also marcus aka keith stanfield is a good rapper 
is he like an actual rapper and john gallagher juniour is a really good bongos player 
yea he is also his rap in the movie is fucking amazing 
yeah it was fantastic all of the kid actors were great 
except for nate that guy was a real cock 
nate i wouldnt call him a kid but he was an even better rapper than marcus 
your right hes more of a assthan he is a kid 
haha true you say asslike its part of the human life cycle or something like baby toddler kid teen got adult 
no for nate its not a cycle its just a line got got ect 
haha why do you hate him so much he just wanted to work with underprivledged kids on his year off from school 
yo what the fuck is that suppose to mean 
hey im sorry man thats not what i menat meant 
yo how about you think before you speak dude assnate 
haha was that his nickname 
marcus gave it to him behind the scenes 
haha id like to think that all the kids on set hated him as much as they hated him in the movie im doing the jeopardy test in an hour 
scared 
so scared 
how it go 
it starts in five minutes 
ahhhhhhhhhh oh no 
haha what finished 
how u do 
no clue they dont tell you your results ever they say youll be contacted anytime in the next year if youve gone to the next step 
woe 
haha yeah its annoying to not find out but i can see why they do it that way 
can you edit a paper for mr mre me 
which one the eu 
yea 
fine send it over 
thanks man 
skype in a couple dont fucking call me man 
srry faggot and im sick so can u just make the edits for me 
no its 2500 words and dont have the energy 
come on 
well thats a really compelling arguement whens it due 
tomorrow 
yeah fuck it then you wont be able to change it in any real way learn the rules of grammar and then pick through it yourself 
fuck off 
u mad bro 
httpthepiratebaysetorrent9452823her2013dvdscrxvidmp3rarbg are you retarted 
haha im already downloadingit why am i stupided 
cause u havent seen it yet 
have you 
i watched it last night it was pre good not super great 
where on your list 
4 or 5 maybe also i watched spectacular now and frozen last night 
thoughts ive seen spectacular now 
i got it from your list it was not bad not a huge fan 
really why 
story was pretty good i guess but not super compelling 
it seems like movies are just about plot to you 
the charectors were also just okay there were some good lines i give it a 75 
the central relationship was so good and so was the acting miles teller had one of the best acting performances of the year 
best scene was with bob odenquirk and main character when he was like asking him to stop drinking and the main character says no and then bob is like if i were your father this would be when i give you a lecture and then teller is like if you were my father you wouldnt have to 
haha yeah that was really good i also liked coach as an alcoholic deadbeat 
he still stood up for the mom tho tamy 
haha how was frozen 
pre good 
really 
yea i will lose best animation to monsters universty 
it was better than that 
yea do u want to skype mum and dad 
yeah if its now i saw her her 
thoughts 
loved ig it joaquin phoenix is amazing 
hows it rank 
the script was fantastic the art direction and cinemetography were off the chain did you see sherlock 
eyey 
and 
so good u see it 
serious yeah i remember when it was a show about solving mysteries 
thats true it it set up next season 
i never thought i would ever compare this show to entourage but here we are 
haha entourage ho2 how 
ill explain after my lunch 
k 
okay so its like entourage because there arent any consequences anymore take when he has to confront his girlfriend to tell her that hes been using her to get into that guys office when he gets to the top of the elevator youd think that hed tell the truth she would get upset and the scene says something about sherlock as a character but instead they get to the office and shes been shot in the head but not fatally watson attends to her and the plot basically forgets about her until sherlock wakes up in the hospital where it turns out that shes used the situation to cash in this both comes completely out of nowhere and lets sherlock off the hook morally she isnt hurt that the man she was dating and nearly engaged to was only using her to get into the office she worked for or that shell probably never get a job again due to her indiscretion and tabloid presence this is problematic for a couple reasons it cheapens the interpersonal relationships on the show by making them unrealistic more importantly it cheapens the character of sherlock he was originally an outlier inhuman due to both his vast intellect and his using other people as a means to an end what was interesting about the show was the contrast then between sherlock and the rest of humanity this central idea fell apart this season by making every secondary character somebody with a dark secret or violent past mary is probably the worst example of this making a human empathetic foil to sherlocks narcissism a trained exspy for the sole purpose of furthering the plot in this one story molly hooper and miss hudson also became like this to a lesser extent with molly holding the secret to how sherlock faked his death and miss hudson being part of an american drug cartel which what it weakens the idea of sherlock as an alien superhero not by making him more human but everybody else less human if everybody is special then nobody is getting back to the consequences they tie a bow on it at the end with moriartys return a character who committed suicide by shooting himself in the head onscreen a few episodes ago is revealed to be alive if this is allowed to happen then we can no longer trust a single thing that happens on screen anymore what stops them from revealing that the bad guy from this episode didnt actually die after sherlock killed him in the episode or doing a double reversal and showing that gasp sherlock actually did die when he jumped off the roof it waves a middle finger at the audience while simultaneously affirming all of their worst tendencies towards ridiculous speculation nothing matters anymore because everything can be redacted having said that the sequence where he keeps himself alive after getting shot was fantastic 
you are a faggot 
lol 
httpmimgurcomgm0v1qm

bike dyke kykes jewish lesbians for safer bike lanes 
how could that even be a restaurant after hours naked the battle of algiers the celebration y tu mama tambien princess mononoke stories we tell videodrome elephant the aviator im seriously considering dropping my cultural studies major and switching to an economics major 
4 reallls why 
i just have so little patience left for cultural studies and i have enough room in my schedule to do it 
ahahhaaha do it so worth it also send me you are resume 
why is it so worth it 
because then u can get a job 
so to you economics degreejob 
better than cult studs 
true 
how do you switch 
oh fuck yes and i think you just do it online like theres no forms or anything to fill out 
have you decided to switch yet 
lol not yet its not like i need to make a decision right now or anything at this point im very seriously considering it 
why 
why what 
do you want to change 
oh because the level of enjoyment im getting from cultural studies isnt enough to justify what im going to end up taking away from it 
ahhahm so why economics 
1 its interesting to me and i dont know much about it 2 itll help with jobs 3 its important politically 4 what else is there 5 httpwwwavclubcomarticlefxannouncesreturndatelouieanditssoon202179

this ama confirms every negative thing i feel about vice httpwwwredditcomriamacomments210eurimvicefoundershanesmithandthethingsisaw 
what u mean 
holy shitballs good job i didnt think it would come so soon 
haha neither did i i sent it wednesday 
yeah damn did rachel hear back 
she hasnt submitted yet 
ah when do you rank your residence choices 
i think i do it any time httpunofficialmcgillguidecomresidences are these accurate 
yup have you given much thought into it or are you still attached to rvc 
based on that review im leaning towards molson or gardener or douglas 
what made you chnage your mind 
the review it got on that site 
the fact that its quiet you mean 
yes 
also dont do douglas 
y imagine that the family oriented brady bunch had a child with the openmindedness of lsd meanwhile the raging partiers of project x had a child with the intense study habits of the youngest ever harvard graduate norman weiner and then these two children grew to a socially acceptable age and conceived a child of their own that child would be a typical gardnerite 
lol what although thats pretty accurate 
y no doug 
the people are terrible generally it definitely has the most consistent legacy of that since almost everybody there is a scholarship kid which tends to mean entitled and douchey also its even quieter than rvc and the building isnt really that nice on the inside 
okkk in the facebook mcgill entering class page 
it begins also there are probably like nine feminist radio shows on mcgills station 
haha goood cant wait in the group there are so many people from france 
also i saw the vagina monologues on friday oh yeah that makes sense 
how was it and a lot of americans going into artss 
yeah there are a lot of international students in general but most are from those places and its too long to go into but it was terrible we all agreed

tinder story from reddit im probably late to the party but ill share because my tinder story is terrible and thats what were all here to seei matched with this really cute girl all of her pictures were professionally done like senior pictures we texted for a few days and she seemed alright not exactly interesting or funny but as any sane male using tinder i wasnt looking for anything more than a hookupone night she invited me to pick her up because she was sneaking out of her house i agreed and drove to her neighborhood to meet her i called her when i was at the gate and she sounded funny it sounded like she was eating and her mouth was full thought nothing of it and waited for her to come outshe rounds the corner walking kinda funny and wearing weird clothes like clothes a 12 year old girl would wear were both 19 she gets in my car and shes kinda making a funny face as she reached to hold my hand without saying hello it hit me this girl was stupidedher little brother came running around the corner yelling telling her to come back because their parents were gonna go crazy she yelled back out of my open window its okay im with my boyfriend hes gonna take care of me i shit my fucking pants i calmly told her she should probably go with her brother but she wouldnt let go of my hand after some convincing she went back with her brother and i sped the fuck out of thereshe called me about 20 times texted me saying she needed me because her parents were going mental being mad at her i sent one text back saying she should listen to them and not sneak out any more and never texted her againshe still texts me to this day inviting me to go places with her family as her boyfriend and i never replynow i skype everyone before i meet them in person

haha devin patterson wrote it i just thought it was a funny idea 
oh shit haha kinda sad all and all 
haha how so 
its a story about nothing whens our bus tomorrow 
httpsiimgurcommkvialxjpg 815am340pm 
ahhahahahahah thats too good 
send me question 11 
ill send mine llater but it looks like we got the same answer 
okay sweet 
big error in your work remember that its thousands of hours not just hours 
yeah i know 
big error dude 
its like boxes of hours one box contains a thousand hours 
then you are dwl is 320000 
no 320 because its one dollar per thousand hours 
no 
counterpoint 
how would a change of 60000 hours in economy cost 120 that is basically nothing 
how would a bag of cheese puffs cost 10 were not dealing in the real world 
suit you are self but i know i am right 
haha hold on httpswwwscribdcomdoc237764973microeconomicsgoolsbee1steditionsolutionsmanual from the solution guide for the textbook 
i think they are wrong 
its the fucking solutions manual 
haha explain how 80000 400004320 
80404320 
but it is 80 thousands thats what i thougjy thought 
haha 
like really tho do u see what i am saying 
yeah i get it but i also see it my way and the answer book confirms it 
haha i honestly cannot see why mine is wrong there is no way it right 
post on the econ group if you dont believe me 
fuck that i know im right 
hahahaahah k ill probably just put an asterix on the bottom of the page 
saying what hey galiana daniel is right 
httpwwwclickholecomarticle8signshescheating723utmcampaigndefaultutmmediumsharetoolsutmsourcefacebook yup 
haha that list 
yeah haha take a picture of question 9 
im at the library and my phone is dead ill take it when i go back to rez 
kk i just realized that the supply curve for that question would be perfectly inelastic thats where i was going wrong 
in 9 
yeah 
i did that at first but it doesnt say that there are 40 spots fixed but that in that year there were 40 spots 
no 
is has to do with howmany they will supply 
your university has an honors program that accepts exactly 40 freshmen each year verbatem from the problem 
fuck yeak that makes the question so much easier what ev 
yeah exactly 
tho she wonmt look at it 
yeah but what if she does 
then practice is canceled 
but coach how am i gonna get to the nfl if i dont practice 
im eli httpjoemontanasrightarmfileswordpresscom201202easyejpg 
haha whatd you get for 9b thats the only one i dont have now 
httpwwwgeeksandcleatscomwpcontentuploads201408elimanningheadshotgeeksandcleatsjpg this is what i got but i dont think its right i dont have 9b or 9e 
hes so rosycheeked i dont see how it could be wrong e is muthafuckin easy 
i didnt look at it what is the questiob 
b b how does the way price is determined in this situation differ from the way we normally think about the determination of equilibrium price 
what is the question e 
instead of expanding the first honors program the faculty recommends introducing a whole new one suppose the first was an honors program in science how would standards change for the science honors program if the new honors program were in math how about art history explain your answers 
oh yeah do u just make a new graph haha 
math would be a substitute good and art history would be its own thing 
oh i see what they are getting at haha fuck that question 
how come 
imean 9 in general 
oh yeah but once you get that its inelastic then its pre easy 
b is just that there is no true inelastic supply in the real world maybe 
well yeah but that doesnt really answer how program requirements are different from price thats more dealing with quantity 
y ye 
i was thinking that program difficulty cant really be quantified as easily money but that seems obvious 
yeah thats all the answer can b 
makes sense i cant think of anything else anyway whatd you get for question 3 just the first part 
i have started it yet 
okay when are you starting also how did your midterm go 
it went okay prob got a b or so its an optional one though so if i did bad its no big deal im going to shower then start it how long does it take 
oh sweet and not long took me like an hour and a half tops 
dope ill do it then tell u what i get can it be submitted online yet 
dont think so apparently the brand new textbook i ordered on amazon didnt come with a code for mystatslab either so im just gonna print it tomorrow and copy my answers to it 
yeahwhat question do we not do 
dont do 9 10 11 and 13 
did we learn how to do 8de 
yeah relative frequency is easy just divide the number in each category by the total number sampled and write whatever the decimal is wheels is 056 for example and e is d a histogram just orders bar graph data by highest frequency to lowest 
is 3 as easy as it seems also whats the formula for outlier 
yeah thats what im wondering about 3 and its zscorexxbarsx also would 3a be 75 25 or 76 24 httpwwwredditcomraskredditcomments219w2owhosthedumbestpersonyouveevermetcgbhkwp 
kevin finished his first semester with a 3 average he tried to bribe me with 11 does this look like all the formulas yo do u make you are crib sheet yet 
working on it now you 
same what is the mid term up to 
i think everything before the hypergeometric unit 
so binomial 
i dont think that either 
kk have u finished you are crub sheet 
nope have you 
waiting on u i havent been taking notes 
what why not 
i dont know when will u be done srry 
i dont know when ill be done 
hm kk what do u have so far i have uptill statistical independence 
im on the general addition rule never mind general multiplication 
alright so you are close to finishing 
relatively 
sweet 
when would we have to use the first partition formula also how are you making yours if you dont have notes 
whats that just from memory 
pasumofpa intersect ei 
lol never heard of it of 
well thats great 
og its common sense 
right are radicals included in hypergeometrics and binomeals 
will we have to know statistical independences do u mean factorial 
yes 
yeah 
thats a hilarious joke i just came up with 
thats before hype and binomials so yea also that joke is shit 
well 
but do we have to know statistical independence 
i assume so since it comes before hypergeometrics and binomeals we wont have to derive them or anything 
not bad done httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1hdaae3sgj4sfwuqiulqnz71nm6d2zktftl4btb8edituspsharing this is what i got 
whats the bottom right one on the first page supposed to calculate also do we need to use linear interpolation for finding tukey outliers 
i dont know yea we do 
kk want to go over the old quizzes between classes tomorrow 
sure u done 
i mean kinda yeah its all sketched out on notepad paper

the question was propose the next evolution of smart razor technology i got an honourable mention 
what u say 
the success of a smart razor that is able to collect data is entirely contingent upon its ability to accurately monitor track and store the various facial hair lengths that its users have if this is technologically possible then i suspect we will see it take over the market of higherend razors displacing the electric razor with its segmented predefined clipon razor guides almost entirely they arent practical now and they certainly wont have a place in a future where the razor of the future exists my idea is a relatively simple one every time you shave your smart razor will track both the length to which youve shaved your hair as well as the pattern of shaving across your face the second caveat is critical due to the fact that it offers the biggest advantage over any razor currently on the market nobody with facial hair wants it to be completely uniform in length across their face most people with beards want a shorter trim in the cheek and sideburn areas with slightly longer facial hair along the jawline as well as the area between the nose and the mouth with current technology being at a standstill of giving differing levels of uniform shave the only way a person can get a more defined facial hair profile is by manually changing out the different razor guides or trimming down certain areas by hand which is inefficient and timeconsuming the smart razor would have a mechanically adjustable guide that is permanently attached to the razor which the user could use to control the space between the razor and the guide and therefore adjust the length of their facial hair as they shave it in a matter of seconds rather than the minutes of frustration that come with experimenting with the right size of razor guide to use since shaving so often factors into the timesensitive morning routine of many men the ability to save even a few seconds of ones time should not be understated let alone the two minutes plus this would likely save per shave it would also create a shaving experience where the user would never again have to worry about how their facial hair looks which is the type of freedom from worry that builds lifetime brand loyalty through the use of accelerometers the razor would be able to track where on the face the user has adjusted the razor guide and can thus note how long or short a users facial hair is on any given part of his face this data could be accessed through some sort of smartphone or desktop application which could connect to the razor itself either through bluetooth wirelessly or through a microusb cable which could serve the dual purpose of charging the razor through the users computer which would give the user data on his previous individual shaves as well as aggregate data on which parts of his face he shaves the most creating a profile of their most commonly used techniques which could then be preset to autoadjust as the user shaves thereby saving even more time the data that users get from a razor like this taps into a fundamental narcissism that people generally have about their own bodies theyre inherently interesting to us because theyre our bodies its why heart rate and blood pressure monitors and bathroom scales sell in such high volumes any objective data we receive from the outside world that applies to our corporeal form fascinates us and keeps us coming back if it can tell us what were doing wrong and how were changing over time the application could also use facial recognition software to load facial hair data from other users and celebrities so the user can replicate something that he likes a technique that was previously only possible through sheepishly showing a barber a picture of who you wanted to look like which users could understandably be embarrassed about asking another person for but would be more than comfortable to do in the comfort of their own home users could have michael fassbenders trademark scruff or nick offermans legendary mustache without having to ask somebody to do it for them it would also offer the opportunity for magazine style sections to offer curated facial hair ideas that could be preloaded into a razor putting the user on the inside track of latest fashion trends while offering the company ad revenue from things like gq or mens fitness as an added bonus it could also through aggregate data offer more normative suggestions as the user shaved for instance if a user missed a spot while they were shaving the razor could inform the user of such a fact in real time through some sort of sound or light alert i feel like the market price for what im proposing would be like six or seven hundred dollars 
not gonna read all that whats the tl dr 
1 replace electric razors with clipon length guides with an automatically adjustable head that does the same thing 2 have the razor be able to run programmed shaving routines that learn how you shave and make adjustments for you as you shave 3 be able to download facial hair profiles from other users and celebrities and mens fashion magazines 4 5 profit 
lame dumb and unoriginal 
cant say i disagree but moneys money holy shit did you just get ccd on an email to galiana 
sec nopel what is it 
oh damn its a thing basically saying that the exam was unfair and that some accommodations should be made to account for it 
screen capp 
they went into a lot of detail over what was wrong with it and it was pretty damning kk 
shit who sent it 
whoever it was sent it from the account econ230mcgill2015hotmailcom 
haha person must have seen their mark and freaked out 
haha yeah i imagine thats what brought it on 
haha 
though they definitely have a point even if some of the stuff sounds kinda juvenile 
haha yea i mean its just hard to agree with from her perspective doubt she will do shit 
haha true i dont see her even responding to this honestly 
ye 
i doubt exam marks can even be changed by the professor after theyve happened 
best she can do is scale 
right which she might do depending on how much effort it would take 
she not gonna do anything think of her utility function for the situation 
i dunno i could see her sitting down to do the function and just completely fucking it up it looks like ill be more well off if i burn my house down 
haha y u postit to group 
i emailed the account to thank them for stepping up and they asked me to post it since not everyone could see it 
soooooooooooo ssssssssssmmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttt 
haha thats me 
u def made the account u too toool 
haha nope 
man my young wan comment is blowin up 
haha i saw that post yesterday and wanted to say something about it oh controversys abrewin 
people are shitting on this post that u made can managment student not have curved marks 
haha i know right and im pretty sure they can why 
haha apperently not lol i mean nothing is gonna happen anyway 
howd it go also do you know if galiana curved the grades down 
pretty bad lol no its our final mark for the year 
thats too bad though you probably did better than you think and i saw people talking about that on the facebook group and there doesnt seem to be a consensus like some peoples marks arent an average of both semesters but maybe they dont know how to calculate an average 
i check mine and yours its the final mark we receive 
yeah for me and you it is but it might not be the same for others 
what are the odds of that happening people are just being dumb no way she curved it 
yeah that makes sense though i wouldnt put it past galiana to randomly curve down half of the class marks you coming over 
just awoke 
cool come over whenever want to get lunch 
where 
i dunno yet we havent decided come over so we can decide you missed a call from chris are you coming were gonna leave soon

k 
wait what do you mean by formatting 
like how many lines are there between paragraphs 
none 
lol library 
ah what do you mean lines 
like after i finish a paragraphh and start a new one do i do enter enter tab or enter tab 
enter tab internet explorer none 
what the fuck it looks werid 
thats what its supposed to be when its double spaced 
kk that works out well for me 
how many words are you at 
2600 just need 2 write my conclusion what about you 
1750 conclusion is like a paragraph 
okay i know that a conculsion is a paragraph but thanks for the heads up you fool 
haha whateva how are you feeling about yours 
uh decent i feel like if i was at this point in the essay 2 weeks ago i could get an a on it 
haha i know what you mean 
how do u feel about you are yours 
bout the same its just tough because i dont really have any primary sources 
what are primary sources like if u talk 2 people 
no like firsthand documents from the time 
oh cool i have a shit tone of those like in the thousands 
yeah because your case didnt end 150 years ago 
min is about y dinosaurs arent real 
haha counterfeiting fossils would have been a good topic actually 
yea thats why i did it the currency in india is fossils 
makes sense rupee means fossil in indian 
rupee means fossil in indian is actually the tittle of my paper 
no caps its very grabby 
yea i havent used punctuation or the space bar in my whole essay 
oh so youre following mla formatting 
ofcourse yo the source we put at the end as in like photocopies or whatever how comprehensive does it have to be 
i have no clue im wondering about that myself because most of my sources are books and i dont know how he wants us to do it 
its shitty cause i was late one day and when i walked in i heard him talking about it he was like you dont have to be super over the top with you are sources i have seen most of them already 
oh okay thats not bad then i feel its more for people who are doing a lot of investigation because he wants to see if the dots really connect

lol was the article he wrote bad 
yeah it had a lot of stuff in it that could be read as antiblack and it was just poorly written 
what antiblack stuff also antiblack is that just racism 
kinda just stuff saying that black people dont care about asian peoples struggle and they get too much of the civil rights attention 
yea nothing worse then all the attention that black people get for the whole civil rights thing i mean come on what a bunch of attention whores than 
haha exactly and he talks about mao like it was racism or something 
what do u mean 
like he talks about being oppressed by mao and compares it to black americans being oppressed

lol yea i got my tribune interview by the way 
yeah i saw theres one other person interviewing for web so it would presumably be you and the other guy 
what is the other guys name 
bill gates 
w0w really tho 
oh wait there are three people clare lyle and samy zarour 
and me 
yeah 
when are there interviews 
ones right after you and the other is two before you

how do you know 2 i believe 
hm is there anyway i should prep for the interview 
are you gonna be around tomorrow i have production but i could come over after 
no i have a midterm thursday so ill be at the library 
oh dang 
but ye any interview prep tips 
go through everything thats wrong with the site and write it down and memorize and think about solutions also look at other news websites for ideas for things you could incorporate into the site try to come up with five for examples 
do u know what questions they are gonna ask 
yeah 
what are they 
why do you want to be web editor what ideas do you have likesdislikes about the site role you think webdev plays for a newspaper how would you want people to contribute what youd want in a managing editor spirit animal comfortable expressing your opinions at edboard 
spirit animal 
yeah what would your spirit animal be 
lol you are not supposed 2 ask that question 
haha why 
because its like a an appropriation thing 
haha nope 
yea 
not even a little bit 
dude some actress had to apologize this year for it 
what no its not appropriation if it gets engrained in the culture en masse 
httpwwwbetcomnewscelebrities20151026kerrywashingtonapologizesforusingthetermspiritanimalhtml 
thats insane thats been a thing forever 
u were wrong dude 
i still dont think its appropriation 
yeah since the early 2000s way longer than those shitty natives have been using it right 
haha oh god 
lol when they ask it should i say that or just give an anwser like a shmuck 
throw a tantrum 
lol yo how long is the interview 
half hour roughly 
really 
maybe more like 20 minutes 
okay thats not bad who will be in the interview 
julia the eic natalie creative director probably mayaz maybe matt andor will and anyone else who happens to be around 
if mayaz is there ill end up calling him richard 
haha bring in a photo of richard and put it up to his face 
ill hold it up to his face with out speaking for a minute or two and then say yea i thought so and walk out of the room 
hahaaha have you seen the latest episode of girls 
ya 
so good 
uh good not so good 
youre talking about the marnie one right 
ya 
oh man i thought that was the best the shows been in a long time 
yea me too best episode of the season just felt like it had some flaws 
like what 
like the whole drug thing was obivous 
yeah i dont think it was supposed to be surprising to the viewer just to marnie 
yea but marnie didnt even seem suprised 
i mean she freaked out and left because of it 
she didnt really freak out 
she was like what the fuck is this 
not really a freak out 
haha whatever you know what i mean the fact that she left at that moment suggests that this was when she realized the extent of what he was into 
haha yea it just could have been better the scene at the end with dezzy was one of the best in the show 
oh man yeah that guy is so good 
also the scene in the dress shop where marnie is talking to the cashire 
haha that scene is why marnie is the best character in the show talking about how much shes lived and how when she looks at her hands she sees the hands of a woman whos worked her whole life like holy shit 
yea so fuvking funny

thats not what claire told me she said i feel bad for dan theyre going to eat him alive 
haha wow such foresight we put up the new site today 
oh lemme check it out not bad dont like how you have to scroll to the bottom to get to ae 
haha its because it is the least important section 
ha analytics would prove you wrong there 
no i checked 2day the least read article of all time is you are feature by the way who knew an article could have less than 0 reads 
haha thank superhacker alexi simakov for that 
haha people were talking about him at orientation during the governance presentation 
haha they talk about the water incident 
no what is that 
we were interviewing him because he was a candidate for something and in the middle of the interview hes like can someone get me a glass of water it was an obvious power move on his part and everybody made fun of him for it after 
ahhahahahaha 
who gave the best presentation at orientation 
i dont know they were all pretty good but none stood out as being great httpsenwikipediaorgwikichristophermintzplasse look alike 
i mean a little whos the guy in the first photo 
it was on some programming site 
httpspbstwimgcommediacophozsusaat3gpjpglarge 
this cant b real where did u find this

if kevin really knew what was up his flag polls wouldnt be so fucking short 
yeah true show some goddamn respect keeler 
hows the studying going 
not bad averaging a 168 lately i just gotta improve my  a few points 
 reading comp 
yup renaissance college 
haha weird that that is a component how do u get better at reading comp tho just learn how to read faster 
partially yeah but being able to answer some questions really quickly too in order to make time for the more labourintensive ones all without sacrificing accuracy 
fuck if you get a 168 on you are lsat you are set tho right 
i mean depends on what you mean by set id be able to get in somewhere but the higher my score the more options i have 
yea thats true i think i may wanna write my lsat too

which one of those plays batman 
corey

the show isnt about batman its about blackman zinnnng 
thats a great comment httpswwwfacebookcomgroups1044455922283296permalink1217662254962661commentid1217665621628991commenttracking7b22tn223a22r227d old segals still at it

pretty chill production day is fun ed board suckss 
haha what dont you like about it 
its just like a long ass conversation that i could care less about same 5 people talking 
haha thats always true who talks the most 
jenna stanwood probabily she was on the board last year right 
yeah i imagine its mostly people who were there last year who talk 
april and nick talk a lot too i have yet to say a word tho 
right yeah haha not even during the circle 
haha i just put duck tape around my mouth when its my turn to talk yea i just dont talk during the ed board discussion 
haha yeah thats fair i remember feeling i had to be super caught up on everything to be able to contribute 
yea i mean i feel like what people say isnt that ground breaking i just dont really find the conversation that interesting also having a conversation with 25 people is less than ideal i was hoping it would be more like this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvy2ih4ghoars 
haha that would be a lot better 
did u torrent transparent 
no prime free trial 
hey howd it go 
i think it went pretty well i did well on lr one of the logic games was weird but otherwise okay  was dece but rushed on the last passage 
so overall how do u feel 
pretty good but i feel like i can do better

haha class dumb person going on a tirade and making no sense like all of the people that she refers to are strawman as fuck 
yes exactly like shes making a point about us being the most apathetic generation and then embeds a graph which shows that its been really consistent over time 
haha yea she is president of aus 
sounds about right httpswwwinstagramcompbmpsmt4jp5h 
ahahahahhahauau 
have you seen dont think twice yet 
no couldnt find a torrent all summer have u 
yeah its online now i watched it last night pretty good 
can u link me 
just look it up i cant at work also i got an apartment 
oh shit do u have pictures 
httprentaplaces3amazonawscomtakyan7320blackburnunit20473420blackburnhtml virtual tour 
3 bed 2 bath 
5 bed 
lol what the fuck is it 2 floors 
nope its the top floor of a house 
its really nice how much 
700 a month 
pretty expensive who else lives there 
true tho all the places were around the same its me and four other randos 
is it a 4 month subleg subltlet 
yuuup 
have u talk 2 the other people 
no dont even know who they are 
howd u find the place then 
theres a website called rent a place 
damn whats the address 
73 blackburn ave 
hm sounds unsavory did u get a job at the health food store 
no those fuckers did a background check on me and found out i wasnt vegan 
haha how did they carry out the background check 
they gained access to my bank statements then called restaurants i had been to and asked them what i ordered 
wow u should get them 2 help out the government of canada with you are background check 
yeah their fucking crack team is too busy sending unmarked surveillance vans to prove that i live where i livr 
haha so no word back on the job front 
noooope not yet anyway its been six weeks now 
how long do they say it takes 
28 weeks apparently 
hm well shit u looking forward 2 moving 2 ottawa 
god yeah im gonna be so excited to get out of this godforsaken town and this godforsaken job 
haha damn y u so salty frederictons a good place 
haha its a nice place but im not experiencing anything i like about it 
ahshah what do u mean 
like i wake up go to work come home write for a bit and then im too tired to do much else then rinse and repeat 
haha that doesnt sound that bad pretty stress free 
i mean compared to school sure but theres the added stress of not knowing where anything is going 
haha yea i mean you are definitely not the only unemployed recent grad in canada 
yeah no shit 
ahahaaha i mean didnt u see this coming 
well yeah but that doesnt necessarily make it okay 
haha yea true but its kinda the nature of the program u were in also u could def get a job if u werent looking only in government 
yeah for sure though i dont even know what id be qualified for in the private sector 
i dont know the private sector doesnt only hire science and engineering students 
yeah they also hire business students skewered 
haha u have an econ degree its like business except not practical at all 
lol but i do know what a giffin good is super useful 
haha econ is just really easy like its fun but the practicality is dubious at best 
oh yeah well thats the case with most bachelors degrees tho 
most arts or science degrees 
and business the only practical one is engineering 
business is pretty practical 
uh 
like all the majors except marketing is good 
hr 
yea like u can get a job 
yeah true 
the catch is u work in hr also the phrase human resources sounds extremely unsettling 
haha hr fact theres enough energy generated by liquidating the human body to power a generator for 100 hours 
haha u should try 2 get a job working for the nb investment fund 120k starting salary 
jesus catch is i have to stay in nb 
i wouldnt stay in nb if u were making 120 k 
haha i wouldnt expect you to 
i mean u wouldnt haha 
oh eh probably not things are more important than money 
yea but its a good cause 
pfft not really cheating old ladies out of their pension money presumably 
haha damn with that attitude you should be working in their pr department

httptinyurlcomho2fcq7 yo whats a decent speed for a laptop processor

wits you are budget 
600 
go higher trust me 
like how much higher 
go to 700 
why httpwwwbestbuycaencaproducthphp156laptopintelcorei36100u1tbhdd8gbramwindows10black15ay028ca10483535aspxpath9db99ff5bbffe2c7ee5d2e96b87d9d95en02 this one is marked down from 700 
because those laptops are kinda bad like u 100 should be getting an ssd rather than hdd 
why i mean theyre faster but you get so much more space with hdd 
haha i guess if u want to store a bunch of stuff on you are laptop its fine but its gonna run slow as a result like u would be better off w an external hard drive 
hm interesting whats a good amount of random access memory ram 
haha thats for the breakdown 8gb is good if u are compairing look at the read write speed the faster the better 
do you mean hard drive speed in rpm or ram speed 
ram speed

ye how can i make it cohere more 
make it longer and more in depth 
lol its already almost 600 wrds 
haha like it doesnt feel like it really settles on making an argument it just feels like a bunch of stuff thrown together also it needs links 
ye true when u say merge this with the next sentence what do u mean 
the first sentence doesnt feel like a sentence 
is this better theres an apocryphal story about henry ford and walter reuther the union head for the ford motor company touring a new factory the two are looking over a balcony at an assembly line of robots when ford turns to reuther and says hey walter how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues walter pauses for a minute and then replies hey henry how are you going to get them to buy cars

what is a personal statement supposed 2 be about 
write a personal essay of not more than 750 words telling the admissions committee why you wish to join the uvic law community and why you believe that your life experiences background and personal attributes are indicative of a strong match between who you are and the community of students that uvic law seeks to build 
kk yea i read it i feel like you could make them want 2 take more 
what do you mean 
also dont say the thing about nb seems kinda petty 
haha fair 
and u implied it in the paragraph b4 
yeah i dunno i feel like i should at least allude to it in some way but maybe change the focus

shit thats crazy where is he gonna live 
on shawns couch he said 
haha man he has been living on couches a lot does he think that they will get enough money 2 start the fund 
he said he was optimisitic about it i mean it wouldnt be very much if each team chipped in a bit

i dunno i havent talked to him in a bit im assuming not since hes in fredericton for the next bit 
oh really when did he go there 
since last week i think 
oh i should have hung out w him does he have his apt anymore 
yeah hes going back to toronto in a week i think 
oh cool lol what the fuck 
psa the new season of love is out 
have u watched 
first six episodes so far what about you 
jchrist how is it 
much better than last season id say not as stupid 
thats probably not that hard 
haha true 
httpswwwfacebookcomevents14906592909677181496278727072441notiftlikenotifid1489202073738114 ahhaahahhahhahaha 
haha god im surprised velk would actually agree to that fun fact about your pal rudolph he is at the nuremberg trial he tried faking amnesia to get out of testifying it didnt work 
hahagagafa what the fuck 
yeah lets do it and haha 
are u down make a doc 4 the bible 
haha sure i mean though i dont really think it needs a bible 
lol well a research doc or something 2 hold an outline 
yeah kk what part of his life should it cover 
hm thats a good question i mean like during the war is interesting and so is the war but also to me the most interesting is his life in spandow and his death 
yeah i know what you mean though i dunno what could be wrung out of a guy spending decades in prison 
very true i dont know could tell the story with flash backs or what ever like it takes place in spandow but its a bunch of flash back but at the same time i think there would be a better way to do it 
mhmm i know what you mean i like the idea of spandau as a frame story though 
like he is was kinda a fuck in almost a funny way i dont know what events it should focus on or what themes it should explore yea true 
yeah its kinda interesting because he was the third highest ranking person in the third reich but i cant think of a single way he actually helped them like he escaped to britain really early into the war and before that he was basically just hitlers lapdog 
yea the fact that he fled to the uk and they sent him back is so funny 
haha yeah 
like i feel like it could be a dark comedy almost but like really dark 
yeah i totally agree 
what the fuck he was born in egypt also he killed him self at 93 years old 
haha yeah like why then of all times httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1m7fxcb0tnkfoazkp1swdy6xx6oazkp9dmmtcfqjkmedituspsharing 
i have heard that he basically went insane and thought the guards were trying to kill him all the time 
he probably wasnt too far off the mark there 
httpsenwikipediaorgwikispandauprisonrudolfhess read this section 
haahahaha holy shit 
the prisons medical officer would inject he is with what was described as a sedative but was in reality distilled water and succeeded in putting he is to sleep 
the prisons medical officer would inject he is with what was described as a sedative but was in reality distilled water and succeeded in putting he is to sleep 
lol 
haha the laziest man in spandau would be a good title 
ahhahahahahah yea haha if he was killed by someone else it was definitely because he was too annoying another potential plot point or way of telling the story is that his son wrote three books about him my father rudolf he is 1986 who murdered my father rudolf he is 1989 and rudolf he ich bereue nichts rudolf he is i do not regret anything 19941998 
haha what the fuck is the son pro his father 
i think so i mean i think that he thinks that his dad was mistreated his dad went to jail when he was 8 and he is refused to see his family for 20 years after that 
yeah thats reasonable he is looks strikingly similar to andy kaufman httpswwwbiographycomimagecfillcssrgbdpr10gfaceh300q80w300mte5ndg0mdu1mtk1ntg0mde1andykaufman95422531402jpg 
ahahhaahha andy kaufman died b4 he is 
a lot of people think andy kaufman faked his death whoops phone died 
u fool 
httpswwwfacebookcomhiphopdxvideos10153639678547006 
ajahahahahaahah 
yo can you send me the site you used to find your apartment 
its a facebook group called university of toronto student housing or something 
kk found it thanks 
is jorya gonna live in the 6 this summer 
no shes in guelph until june and then moving back home for a couple months 
oh so are u gonna live in toronto or no 
how far do you live from jared yeah i think i will just looking at the specifics now 
like 10 minutes via ttc 
oh not bad 
whats you are budget 
i dunno yet im emailing excel this afternoon to talk about work options but ideally id be paying less than 750month 
ye where do u want to live would u live w jared in his living room 
haha no maybe for a week or something but not ideally ideally id find a place in riverdale or cabbagetown due to the proximity 
yea if u find a place in riverdale you will save some money 
and hamburgers 
haha have u got the letter from unb yet 
dunno just texted mum about it 
well she would have mentioned it if u had 
yeah probably 
if you are looking for a place in riverdale u prob wont find it on the uoft page 
okay 
i dont know where it would be 
hm craigslist i suspect or kijiji 
yea is jared back in toronto 
i think so why dont you ask him 
just curious hows ue job by the way 
pretty good everybodys pretty cool and i just listen to podcasts all day the job itself is pretty mindless opening envelopes and then balancing cheques 
how many weeks is it 
35 so until april 7 
not bad do u think u will get something in toronto through excel 
thats the idea yeah i just emailed them to ask about it depending on what they say i might go through other temp places as well 
yea i bet there are a shit ton of places 
yayayaya the hardest part is going to be finding a place like apartment hunting is the fucking worst thing 
haha yea true its gonna take a while 
ugh 
especially in toronto 
ughhhhhhh ill just live outside i wish they had real estate brokers for people in my situation 
haha 
by the way i watched star wars last nigth 
oh shit what u think had u not seen it 
nope havent seen any of them all the way through pretty good i suddenly understood a lot of references watching it 
haha yea 
im watching the rest of the trilogy today probably 
i am planning on watching the rest soon too 
nice i have one unanswered question though wheres yoda 
ahhaahhaha

lol did she respond 
yeah she said she didnt have anything what a fucking liar right 
fuckd in the head how is the search coming 
its going well the main issue i think will be finding something reasonably close to where you and jared live 
yea i mean either way you are gonna have 2 buy a metro pass 
my thoughts exactly 
so living a little further isnt a big deal reall 
ive just been keeping the group tab open and checking whenever i get a notification i figure ill nab something good if i do that long enough 
yea timing is key it seems 
yeah like if im the first person to message someone thats all it takes usually httpsiredditfsj7t7perhnyjpg 
ahahahahahahahah 
how much are you paying for your place in toronto

final just for an online course that i dont really care about though haha like 5 pages of b work is all i need the prof is super chill 
kk yea ill do it what time on sunday is it due 
no specific time morning or early afternoon would be awesome u the bomb if you could just toss me your topic and like reaaaaally brief outline some day this week thatd be awesome gotta send it to my prof

hey u guys still at peel pub 
hey daniel how are you finei just have a question i need to make a presentation in school about the canadian art scene maybe you can help mewhich are the most popular music and film festivals and do have an idea which is an important painter in canadalove from germany 
hey the most famous painters in were a collection of painters called the group of seven they did lots of paintings of nature httpenwikipediaorgwikigroupofsevenartiststhe most famous film festival is the toronto international film festivalhttpenwikipediaorgwikitorontointernationalfilmfestivalthe most famous music festival is called osheagahttpenwikipediaorgwikiosheagafestivalif you have anymore question message me 
thank you maybe i will write you if there are more questions hey i have one more question can you tell me more famous and important events or festivals in canada 
here is a list of the top festivals in canada they are all in the summer because we cant have them in the winter on the list a big one is called evolve it is popular with kids our age all of these festivals are cool because they have different types of music native country rock blues folk ect httpibackpackcanadacomsummermusicfestivalsincanada 
hey man i know this is kind of random but im also in comp 251 this semester and i was just wondering if youre down to compare some answers for the first assignment 
hey man yea sure i am not done yet tho ill hit u up tomorrow when im done if that works for u 
yeah sure are you going to office hours 
i dont know prob not hey man still down to compare assignment 
yeah for sure did you get more collisions for multiplication than division in q1 
yea i did for some values 
weird my collisions are around the same for all values that i put for w im still working on my answer for 4 and 1 
yo are u sure about you are answer for q2 
did i mess up somewhere i just did build max heap first which was like 3 steps but 2 of the steps were redundant 
mine is different but should the sorting be lowest to highest or highest to lowest 
i think its lowest to highest since thats the way he had it in his slides 
oh shit oh actually its not hard to fix 
yeah itll be quick 
ye for question 1 did you are values look similar 2 mine 
mine was kind of weird changing the value of the second argument didnt do anything it would only change with the value of r 
w should change the size of the possible numbers 
i didnt use w for the division method i just used generate random numbers in range 
the range u have to use is 0 2w these methods will generate n random keys in the range 0 2w and return the number of collisions thats from the assignment 
oh damn mine was using 2r weird even if i change it to 2w i still get the same results 
send a screen cap of you are code and ill take a look if u want 
public double multiplicationmethodimpl int r int n int w double a counter for number of collisions returned at end of methoddouble collisioncounter 0 array for storing key values initialized with size m with 0 at each index but incremented after it has been occupied in order for collision tracking to beginint keyarray new intintmathpow2r iterate through keyarray and hash keys using multiplication method checking for number of collisions while hashing the keys for int i 0 i n i double key ageneraterandomnumberiinrange0 mathpow2w1 mathpow2w cast hashedkey to int before shifting since only ints can be bit shifted int hashedkey intkey wr if keyarrayhashedkey 0 keyarrayhashedkey else collisioncounter return collisioncounter 
you are key array should be size n not 2r 
the size of the array is supposed to be m which is 2r right since load factor is nm where n is keys and m is slots 
m is the number of buckets yea 
and in the assignment it says m2r md2r 
yea you have 2 generate n keys tho 
yeah but the size of the array is the number of buckets my for loop iterates through n times which means i generate n keys since each loop i generate one hashed keys 
yea i see what u mean can u send me a picture of a graph u are getting 
sure one sec 
what were u r and w for that one 
this was 832 
here is my 8 32 
i get the exact same as 816 
hmmmmm 
oh wait i think theres an updated jar file wait never mind lol the values are still the same laughing my ass off 
maybe u values are right tho do u think they are not 
no my values match my graph 
no i mean like how do u know that you are data is wrong 
yeah true theoretically they should be wrong tho every textbook shits on the division method and talks about how much better multiplication is 
i thought that was because of computation time not how effective the hash was 
no those are the number of collisions i think 
oh shit this is what the to said 
ya i saw that 
i dont know our values arent even that different they kinda are but i dont know 
yea for sure i just have no idea how to explain why its theoretically wrong because of my implementation 
yea same im just gonna say fuck it at this point for that question 
yeah same 
yo for q3 what does the second half after the plus sign represent i got the first half but no the second 
thats the number of empty locations after n keys have been hashed 
oh u are missing a parenthesis at the end of you are notation 
fuck going to just highlight 
also is that n 11alpha or an n 
n 
oh haha kk i was confused 
damn the scanners at mclennan suck lol 
lol ye on q3 ecollisions n m eemptyslots how does that work i thought that n m was the number of collisions 
its nespots occupied which simplifies to nmempty slots 
oh shit 
it makes sense because when n is greater than spots occupied thats the surplus ones which are collisions 
lol i just missed the submission by liike 2 minutes 
haha they usually dont mind if its within like an hour 
dude is a fucking savage 
laughing my ass off thats fucked might be a prank though 
haha man fucking tas 
hey

what links exist between characterization setting and themereferencing specific examples where else might you encounter the novels dominant themes what these 
the second one is comparing the themes in the book to other works of fiction or real life events first is exactly how its worded 
kk politically satirical comedy is redundant 
politic make fun bad 
that was for robert 
you think all asians look the same 
all non whites 
what does the sheet say we have to do for the conclusion 
please offer a brief personal reflection on the novel as a whole comment on the novels strengths and weaknesses and its merits as good literature

httpscratchmiteduprojects26698310 
niiicce 
send me you are question 3 file 
one sec post the question 
lets define the following variablesint x 20double d 31416string s hgive the type the next lines evaluate to eg 33 evaluates to an int1 x202 dx 3 s s x4 125 1026 120 
yeah im pretty sure you get 0 cause 1 and 2 are both ints 
yeah u get 0 but if u call it a double then u get 05 
the type of the operation is still an int i think you would have to convert something 
you dont have to convert the 10 and 20 are assumed from 1 and 2 
give me 1 moment i get 00 when i do the doubel 
sht me 2 never mind other than that i got the same answers 
sweet is my format okay 
i dont know about how u answered question b like putting a comma between each output 
yeah how did you do it cause they want one line right 
baw 263 21251 0 05 representes a new line all in one line in txt 
hm its probably automated 
the marking i doubt it 
oh well then commas are fine 
ture true 
you eat yet 
yeah bmh has ribs and chicken they are pretty fucking goof good 
lol they sound pretty goof im going to go eat those 
they arereally goof they maybe out 
ill just eat a croissant then dude they put fucking grapefruit in the sushi there 
ahhahahahahaah 
i almost vomed 
did u eat it 
yeah 
what else was in it 
like tuna and avacado 
haha can u take a look at my code and compare it to yours 
you have mine 
not compare just look it over and see if u made any mistakes also what diid u get on the first assignment it was posted on mycourses if i made 
i dont make mistakes dude i got 102 
me too that fuckeri it was like u should have printed the three laws never said that 
yeah it did 
like come on1 did u write them 
yeah but the guy said i had no comments but i clearly did lol tautology who do you think u r 
i didnt know what to call it i paniced 
why do you call checkinputcorrect at the end of your while 
sec good save 
i dont think yo uneed numberinput either 
uh if its shit like that they wont care 
its wasting memory 
come to think of it my computer did crash 12 times while trying to run the program are u going 2 comp tomorrow 
you should have got more than 30 bytes of ram uh guess i could 
after lets eat at rvc 
okay your code is weird as fuck 
haha how 
temp doesnt need to be a double and characterdigit is unecessary but if it works who cares 
fuck the pow shit 
you need to comment q2 i guess you should probably put comments on your methods in q1 too 
yeah fuck commenting 
on mine i just wrote comments about jwows ugly clothes yeah the only thing in q2 is that your spaces are being printed out by drawparabola so you dont really need the last else in the main but it works so whatever 
httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1hjvslsrbommj9fyzr3vef2cssb527dp3wxpyvxvpwbwpubhtml 
this is with all the features i could think of give me your email ill send you the assets also dont open this one 
 why did u send that 
dunno i made it like 2 years ago and just found it lol 
is it a virus 
no 
what is it 
open it 
haha scriptkiddyfggt 
hacked 
i look at the jar tomorrow i have 2 exams 
kk good luck on your pirate ship 
here is the main screen anychanges 
cool maybe do a gradient for the background 
kk 
the chain would be good for the bar in the playstate 
yes should i leave it on the main page top or take it off 
keep it so after this menu there will be like a normalcasual menu 
yeah what should show up when u click play 
you figure it out i can change around the menus really easily though 
changes 
there needs to be space for a back button and a turn counter i pretty much finished the scrolling so the top is usable 
turn counter 
yeah how many tries you have left 
oh i thought it was timed 
its both 
do one or the other 
tries makes more sense but i feel like there should still be a time limit to be more tense 
there could be 2 seperate modes 
casual is not timed challenge should still be timed though 
casual can be turns and challenge can be timed 
why shouldnt challenge have both 
too much info on screen 
hm maybe youre right lets put it in first and see how it looks 
too much workkk 
i already coded it in literally just a number 
but i have to make the buttton 
just use the template from the timer 
time and turns is too hard 
i changed the turns to 12 10 18 15 do you think thats fine 
four colors and 4 spots hardest could be 8 i think like it is do able 
four spots is still five colors cause it would be a huge pain to make it less for different modes 
cant it be 4 colors all modes 
yeah that easier but on five spots 5 colors would work better 
why 
you can make a rainbow code obvs 
haha what 
rainbow code 
what is that 
rainbow code 
4 colors logical 
5 colors exciting 
i already pick 4 colors i cant adda 
each peg color is a different picture just do one more picture 
yeah but i pick four colors adding another throws off the balance of the colors 
they all look like brown to me add a white one thats goes with everything 
if i add a white then it will blend into the chain four iis the right ansnwer trust me 
its too easy on five pegs add a beige one 
ill a color if there is no timer and turn on the same screen 
fine 
i added a yellow alreadyy looks gayyyy 
well our target demographic is the gay community so 
true have u made the high score page asin the code for it 
yeah i just dont know if itll actually store 
should u be able to know without testing 
no i need to put it on a phone 
kk and can u do animation on buttons 
yeah well depends on what 
like fading in and out 
yeah but we can do better than that 
when the app opens what kind of animation were u think on the title and buttons 
maybe like the bubble can move sideways on the chain and the chain can move up and down into the next button positions and like a color shift for the background but im not really sure how to do that 
yeah that sounds good 
heres the newest multiplayers broken at the mome though 
kk public static int bubblesortstring a int comparisons 0int n alengthstring temp for int i 0 i n i for int j 1 j n i j if compareaj 1 aj 1 temp aj 1aj 1 ajaj tempcomparisonsreturn comparisons is this bubble sort 
yeah but the outside loop should be a while and check if the inside makes one loop without swapping anything 
but then it wont sort 
it will actually yours isnt bubblesort looking at it more closely wanna bmh 
yeah i need to shower bring you are laptop we can work on the app after meet there at 7 
send me art 
what do u still need 
title an buttons and instructions have you entered a topcoder 
no what do u have to do 
oh you just sign up for it but i was gonna ask if you knew where to get the source code for a project 
oh it should be on the right hand side for downloads 
theres nothing there and its first 2 finish 
there should be some shit 
i think you have to ask for it 
really fuck 
but if you don ill look like a squeeb if i do it

kk whole thing is fucked ill do the finish up work when i get back aside from ui how much work does it require

no its all fucked up all i need to do is build the list view and make sure that the aspect ratio changes on each device 
lol what errors are you getting 
its asking for a gradle home 
yeah i think i had to do some build configurations but i dont remember what just take the loan and friend classes and make the exlistviews out of instances you manually make 
where do the i make the instance in main 
yeah should be just like creating any object 
kk sounds good do i have to use the loan list adapter 
oh yeah probably but it might not work with expendable list view 
kk did u make the adapter you are self 
most of it is copied from somewhere 
kk spookey u coming to class 
fuck i forgot 
meet up at rvc at 645 were going to eat then we meet the dudes at 730 
cool are you downtown already 
ye u here 
yp ill do the display 
kk thanks 
no problem 
wanna go to the bank 
yup 
meet me at leacock in an hour 
okay 
actually just come down now 
i wanna finish watching something but ill be down at like 215 
kk 
i just started walkimf 
kk 
come to kazu 
got 2 werk ill come if u send me assignment 3 here is holdens login 7r11nx 
yeah ill send you it 
when wewe eatin 
walk down at 530 third question i dont know what the fuck whats the mimi server address 
mimicsmcgillca 
whats holdens username 
hkoivu 
what do you want me to do 
just take the input from the form 
does login work 
no that all u have to fix 
the function 
oh the fuction um prob not the string splitting may be fucked but the idea is there 
where do you get the password from 
password and username come from the forum form 
stdin 
the top lines doesnt work yea 
whats the format 
like i dont think the fetching of username works and i have no idea couldnt find it anywhere 
yeah it looks like youre just storing the whole form in username 
yea thats prob whats happening i dont know 
are there libraries that he gave us for this 
i dont think so 
how do i test 
you have to compile on the cgi server then go to the page and try logging in if you are code works then u confirm by changing the if statement in login just print something random to check 
what the fuck is mems supposed to be reading from the file 
sec 
why are you using a 2d array 
so it goes like name and username in each row so say there are 5 users it is a 2x5 array 
but its a local variable so everytime you read a line its reset 
ouf whoop 
do you need to store all of that in the c file 
all of what the users and passwords 
all of the users and names seems to me like you just need to check the input against the file right 
yeah you could do that i was doing it like that because its how i did it in python but its hard to do in c change it how ever u want 
wait just tell me what the input and output of this file is supposed to be 
input is the form that has a login attempt containing username and password out put is either running a myfacebookpagepy if login works and if login fails send back to homepage 
and you do that by sending a form 
yea i think 
okay that should be pretty simple 
yea the only hard thing is reading the form 
your login is pretty fucked up though lol 
yeah it is completely non functional 
whats the format of the form coming in 
i think its usernameuserentrypassworduserentry 
kk 
not sure though 
okay how do i compile 
u have to compile in a special place holden knows how i dont 
cant just be in the cgibin 
no u have to compile on a different server or some shit holden knows 
well holdens not responding wanna come over and play some hits 
im at trottier hes online right now 
yea he responded 
u figure it out 
he doesnt know 
he did it he has to know 
whats the link to the website 
to the server or to our site 
the site 
httpcsmcgillcahkoivuwebcomp206welcomehtml nice 
yeah im working on it lol there has to be a fucking library for this 
haha i maybe wrong in terms of how input looks
